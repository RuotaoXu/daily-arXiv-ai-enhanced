*M. Salman Shaukat,Yannik Käckenmeister,Sebastian Bader,Thomas Kirste*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出在无真实数据训练条件下进行水下3D目标检测：合成训练+模板匹配两路方案。合成数据训练的深度模型在真实声呐数据上遭遇严重域偏移；无需训练的模板匹配在真实场景表现更稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下多波束声呐点云的3D检测受限于昂贵且难以获取的标注数据以及恶劣声学环境，导致深度学习方法难以落地。作者想回答：在没有真实训练数据的情况下，能否实现可靠的水下3D检测？

Method: 双路径框架：1) 物理驱动的声呐仿真管线，生成大规模合成点云用于训练现有SOTA神经网络；2) 基于几何先验的模型/模板匹配系统（无训练），针对人工结构进行稳健匹配。并在波罗的海真实测深数据上评测。

Result: 神经网络在仿真数据上mAP 98%，但在真实数据上因域偏移降至40% mAP；模板匹配在真实数据上达到83% mAP，无需任何训练，且对噪声与环境变化更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 单纯依赖合成数据训练的深度学习在水下域存在显著域差距；基于物理与几何先验的训练自由方法在真实应用更可靠。论文提供首个大规模训练自由水下3D检测基准，并为AUV导航、海洋考古与海上基础设施监测等数据稀缺场景提供可行路径。

Abstract: Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers
in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh
acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has
revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a
critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively
expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert
surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental
question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without
real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing
two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam
echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar
simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art
neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that
leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry
surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks
trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated
scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.
Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data
without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic
noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom
about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first
large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work
opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine
archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments
where traditional machine learning approaches fail.

*Shudipta Banik,Muna Das,Trapa Banik,Md. Ehsanul Haque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MobileDenseAttn：将MobileNetV2与DenseNet201双流特征级融合，并结合Grad-CAM用于MRI脑肿瘤多分类；在严格五折交叉验证上达98.35%测试准确率与稳定F1=0.9835，较基线更准且更快，并提供可解释性热图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MRI脑肿瘤自动诊断方法泛化性差、计算开销大、可解释性不足，影响临床信任与落地。作者希望在保证高准确度的同时提升效率与可解释性，并适应多种异质肿瘤。

Method: 构建双分支融合模型MobileDenseAttn：分别采用MobileNetV2与DenseNet201提取多尺度特征，在特征层进行融合；结合注意力/Grad-CAM以强化重要区域并提供可视化解释；使用包含胶质瘤、脑膜瘤、垂体瘤及正常的增强数据集（6020张MRI），进行严格五折交叉验证评估，并与VGG19、DenseNet201、MobileNetV2作对比。

Result: 在五折下训练准确率99.75%、测试准确率98.35%、F1=0.9835（95%CI:0.9743–0.9920）；较VGG19等基线准确率提升约+3.67%，训练时间较VGG19减少39.3%；Grad-CAM能清晰定位肿瘤相关区域。

Conclusion: MobileDenseAttn在准确率、效率和可解释性上均优于常见基线，表现稳定且具临床潜力，可作为脑肿瘤MRI多分类的实用候选工具。

Abstract: The detection of brain tumor in MRI is an important aspect of ensuring timely
diagnostics and treatment; however, manual analysis is commonly long and
error-prone. Current approaches are not universal because they have limited
generalization to heterogeneous tumors, are computationally inefficient, are
not interpretable, and lack transparency, thus limiting trustworthiness. To
overcome these issues, we introduce MobileDenseAttn, a fusion model of dual
streams of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 that can help gradually improve the
feature representation scale, computing efficiency, and visual explanations via
GradCAM. Our model uses feature level fusion and is trained on an augmented
dataset of 6,020 MRI scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors,
and normal samples. Measured under strict 5-fold cross-validation protocols,
MobileDenseAttn provides a training accuracy of 99.75%, a testing accuracy of
98.35%, and a stable F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). The
extensive validation shows the stability of the model, and the comparative
analysis proves that it is a great advancement over the baseline models (VGG19,
DenseNet201, MobileNetV2) with a +3.67% accuracy increase and a 39.3% decrease
in training time compared to VGG19. The GradCAM heatmaps clearly show
tumor-affected areas, offering clinically significant localization and
improving interpretability. These findings position MobileDenseAttn as an
efficient, high performance, interpretable model with a high probability of
becoming a clinically practical tool in identifying brain tumors in the real
world.

### [3] [Can VLMs Recall Factual Associations From Visual References?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18297)
*Dhananjay Ashok,Ashutosh Chaubey,Hirona J. Arai,Jonathan May,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 受控实验发现：当实体仅以图像而非文字提示时，现有VLM在事实回忆能力约减半；通过读出模型内部状态可提前识别这类失败，探针在标记不可靠回答上达92%+准确率，并在选择性预测中同时提升覆盖并降低风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管VLM在有文字线索时能调用知识，但在真实多模态应用中常需从图像理解实体并联结到内部知识。作者怀疑现有模型在“图像→知识”链接（多模态落地/grounding）上存在系统性薄弱点，且这种薄弱可能在模型内部表征中可检测。

Method: 1) 设计受控实验：比较在相同问题下，提供文字实体提示 vs 仅提供视觉实体提示的表现差异，以量化知识回忆的衰减；2) 分析模型内部状态（如中间层表征/注意模式）以寻找与失败相关的可辨别模式；3) 训练或构建轻量探针，对内部状态进行二分类以预测回答是否可靠；4) 将探针用于VQA的选择性预测（风险控制）：仅在探针判定可靠时输出。

Result: - 当被迫依赖图像表征时，模型的事实回忆能力约降低一半，显示“知识—图像”链接困难；- 内部表征出现与失败相关的特定可识别模式；- 探针对“不可靠响应”的识别准确率超过92%；- 在VQA选择性预测中，探针使覆盖率绝对提高7.87%，同时将错误风险绝对降低0.9%。

Conclusion: 当前VLM存在系统性、可检测的多模态落地缺陷：难以将内部知识与图像实体对齐。利用内部状态探针可有效预警失败并改善风险-覆盖权衡。作者建议沿两条线推进：一是训练与数据上增强实体级跨模态对齐与检索；二是将可解释的不确定性估计（如探针）整合到推理与选择性输出中，以提高多模态理解的可靠性。

Abstract: Through a controlled study, we identify a systematic deficiency in the
multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs). While VLMs can recall
factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their
ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual
instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves
their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to
link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We
show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct
patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states
achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is
unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a
VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of
multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual
question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while
also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic,
detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we
provide informed recommendations for future directions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: N/A

Method: N/A

Result: N/A

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: We propose a semantic-aware neural reconstruction method to generate 3D
high-fidelity models from sparse images. To tackle the challenge of severe
radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse input, we enrich
neural implicit representations by adding patch-based semantic logits that are
optimized together with the signed distance field and the radiance field. A
novel regularization based on the geometric primitive masks is introduced to
mitigate shape ambiguity. The performance of our approach has been verified in
experimental evaluation. The average chamfer distances of our reconstruction on
the DTU dataset can be reduced by 44% for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon. When
working as a plugin for those dense reconstruction baselines such as NeuS and
Neuralangelo, the average error on the DTU dataset can be reduced by 69% and
68% respectively.

*Nowshin Sharmily,Rusab Sarmun,Muhammad E. H. Chowdhury,Mir Hamidul Hussain,Saad Bin Abul Kashem,Molla E Majid,Amith Khandakar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出用轻量级深度学习与模型集成在AerialWaste航片数据上进行非法填埋场二分类，达约92%的综合指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非法填埋点人工排查困难、成本高且易漏检，公开高质量数据稀缺；需要自动化、可扩展的方法在多源异质航片上可靠识别填埋场，以辅助监管、降低环境与公众健康风险。

Method: 使用AerialWaste数据集（10434张，来自AGEA正射、WorldView‑3、Google Earth，多质量多来源）。对多种CNN/ViT系轻量模型（MobileNetV2、GoogLeNet、DenseNet、MobileViT等）进行训练与验证，发现复杂大模型易过拟合；据此选取轻量模型，并通过集成与特征/概率融合（ensemble & fusion）构建二分类器。

Result: 轻量模型相较重模型过拟合更少、泛化更好；最终集成模型在二分类任务上达到：准确率92.33%、精确率92.67%、召回率92.33%、F1=92.41%、特异度92.71%。

Conclusion: 在多源航片上，轻量级模型结合集成策略可有效识别非法填埋点，性能稳定且训练更易避免过拟合；为资源受限与大规模部署场景提供可行方案，亦提示未来应进一步扩充跨地区数据与鲁棒性检验。

Abstract: Illegal landfills are posing as a hazardous threat to people all over the
world. Due to the arduous nature of manually identifying the location of
landfill, many landfills go unnoticed by authorities and later cause dangerous
harm to people and environment. Deep learning can play a significant role in
identifying these landfills while saving valuable time, manpower and resources.
Despite being a burning concern, good quality publicly released datasets for
illegal landfill detection are hard to find due to security concerns. However,
AerialWaste Dataset is a large collection of 10434 images of Lombardy region of
Italy. The images are of varying qualities, collected from three different
sources: AGEA Orthophotos, WorldView-3, and Google Earth. The dataset contains
professionally curated, diverse and high-quality images which makes it
particularly suitable for scalable and impactful research. As we trained
several models to compare results, we found complex and heavy models to be
prone to overfitting and memorizing training data instead of learning patterns.
Therefore, we chose lightweight simpler models which could leverage general
features from the dataset. In this study, Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet,
MobileVit and other lightweight deep learning models were used to train and
validate the dataset as they achieved significant success with less
overfitting. As we saw substantial improvement in the performance using some of
these models, we combined the best performing models and came up with an
ensemble model. With the help of ensemble and fusion technique, binary
classification could be performed on this dataset with 92.33% accuracy, 92.67%
precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score and 92.71% specificity.

### [6] [Structures Meet Semantics: Multimodal Fusion via Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18322)
*Jiangfeng Sun,Sihao He,Zhonghong Ou,Meina Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出“结构-语义统一器”(SSU)用于多模态情感分析，通过结构建图+语义锚点+多视角对比学习，兼顾模态内结构关系与跨模态语义对齐，在MOSI/MOSEI上达SOTA且更高效、可解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态融合往往忽视：1) 各模态内部的结构依赖（如文本句法、声学与视觉的时空/局部关系）；2) 跨模态语义错配导致对齐不准和鲁棒性差；3) 解释性不足与算力开销大。需要一种同时刻画模态内结构、实现跨模态一致且高效的统一框架。

Method: 1) 结构建模：动态构造模态特定图。文本用句法依存构图；语音与视觉用轻量的文本引导注意力构图，捕捉细粒度的模态内关系与与文本的交互。2) 语义锚点：由全局文本语义提取，作为跨模态对齐枢纽，统一并协调各模态语义空间，缓解异构差异与错配。3) 多视角对比学习：设计覆盖模态内与跨模态视角的对比目标，增强判别性、语义一致性和结构连贯性。4) 计算效率：轻量图构建与注意力机制，减少算力开销。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI与CMU-MOSEI上稳定取得SOTA，同时显著降低计算开销。定性结果显示模型具有更强可解释性，能捕获细腻情感线索与语义对齐关系。

Conclusion: SSU通过“结构图+语义锚点+多视角对比”统一建模，提升多模态表示的质量、可解释性与鲁棒性，并以更低计算成本达SOTA；方法具备通用性，适用于多种多模态情感场景。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to infer emotional states by
effectively integrating textual, acoustic, and visual modalities. Despite
notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect
modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting
their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU),
which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and
cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations.
Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging
linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism
for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal
relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic
anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal
alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across
modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective
that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence
across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used
benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing
computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative
analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture
nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.

### [7] [FastAvatar: Instant 3D Gaussian Splatting for Faces from Single Unconstrained Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18389)
*Hao Liang,Zhixuan Ge,Ashish Tiwari,Soumendu Majee,G. M. Dilshan Godaliyadda,Ashok Veeraraghavan,Guha Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastAvatar 是一个从单张任意姿态人脸图像瞬时（<10ms）生成高质量3D高斯点渲染（3DGS）头像的前馈框架，通过“模板3DGS+残差预测”的网络设计，实现快速、稳健且保身份的重建，并支持实时身份插值与属性编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS人脸生成要么依赖耗时的每人优化（质量高但慢），要么前馈方法速度快但在跨姿态保真与身份保持上不足，且缺乏可编辑性。需要一个既快又准、姿态不敏感并可编辑的方案以满足交互与消费级应用。

Method: 1) 以多视角人脸数据学习一个通用3DGS“模板”脸；2) 设计编码器–解码器，将单张输入图像编码为“身份特定但姿态不变”的潜变量；3) 解码器仅预测模板中每个高斯的结构与外观参数的残差（而非全量参数），实现快速稳健前馈拟合；4) 潜空间特设以支持身份插值与属性编辑。

Result: 相较前馈方法（如 GAGAvatar）重建质量显著提升；相较每人优化方法（如 FlashAvatar、GaussianAvatars、GASP）推理速度快约1000倍；单张输入、任意姿态，推理<10ms，并展示实时的身份与属性编辑能力。

Conclusion: 通过模板化3DGS与残差前馈预测，FastAvatar在保证身份与跨姿态鲁棒性的同时，实现了极快的单张人脸3D重建，并引入可编辑潜空间，适合用于消费级与交互式的高真实感头像应用。

Abstract: We present FastAvatar, a pose-invariant, feed-forward framework that can
generate a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from a single face image from an
arbitrary pose in near-instant time (<10ms). FastAvatar uses a novel
encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity
preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face
``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures.
Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and
pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict
residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the
template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion,
model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms
existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction
quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g.,
FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent
space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing
which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation
framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and
speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in
consumer and interactive systems.

*Giuseppe Stragapede,Sam Merrick,Vedrana Krivokuća Hahn,Justin Sukaitis,Vincent Graf Narbel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 面向人道/应急场景的移动生物识别系统，采用轻量的PolyProtect模板保护，对人脸与指纹嵌入做不可逆与不可链接变换；在埃塞真实数据上验证识别性能与隐私安全，结果可用且将开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人道与应急行动需要高效身份核验，但传统生物识别暴露数据主体风险，尤其在脆弱环境（冲突、难民营、弱治理）。需有满足功能、操作、隐私与安全要求的模板保护方案，兼顾准确性、效率与设备资源受限。

Method: 1) 系统化梳理并形式化这些场景的功能、操作及安全/隐私需求；2) 全面比较现有BTP方法，基于有效性、模块化、计算开销筛选出PolyProtect（面向神经网络人脸嵌入的多项式保护变换）；3) 采用EdgeFace（高效SOTA特征提取）提取人脸嵌入，评估PolyProtect在验证、识别、不可逆性、不可链接性上的表现；4) 扩展到指纹嵌入，首次评估其在识别场景与指纹模态上的适用性；5) 使用来自埃塞的人道项目真实数据进行实验。

Result: PolyProtect在移动端可行，计算负担小；在人脸与指纹上均取得有前景的准确率，同时展示出较好的不可逆性与不可链接性（降低模板泄露风险与跨库关联风险）。尤其在人脸识别的验证/识别任务上维持较好性能，指纹首次评估结果同样积极。

Conclusion: PolyProtect是适配资源受限与高风险人道场景的有力BTP方案，具备模态无关与模块化优势，能在保证准确度的同时增强隐私与安全。作者计划开源代码，为后续实证与部署铺路。

Abstract: In humanitarian and emergency scenarios, the use of biometrics can
dramatically improve the efficiency of operations, but it poses risks for the
data subjects, which are exacerbated in contexts of vulnerability. To address
this, we present a mobile biometric system implementing a biometric template
protection (BTP) scheme suitable for these scenarios. After rigorously
formulating the functional, operational, and security and privacy requirements
of these contexts, we perform a broad comparative analysis of the BTP
landscape. PolyProtect, a method designed to operate on neural network face
embeddings, is identified as the most suitable method due to its effectiveness,
modularity, and lightweight computational burden. We evaluate PolyProtect in
terms of verification and identification accuracy, irreversibility, and
unlinkability, when this BTP method is applied to face embeddings extracted
using EdgeFace, a novel state-of-the-art efficient feature extractor, on a
real-world face dataset from a humanitarian field project in Ethiopia.
Moreover, as PolyProtect promises to be modality-independent, we extend its
evaluation to fingerprints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that PolyProtect has been evaluated for the identification scenario and
for fingerprint biometrics. Our experimental results are promising, and we plan
to release our code

### [9] [Why Relational Graphs Will Save the Next Generation of Vision Foundation Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18421)
*Fatemeh Ziaeetabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 主张在视觉基础模型（FMs）中引入显式“动态关系图”接口，以提升对实体、角色与时空关系的推理能力；跨人类动作与医学影像两域证据表明，FM+图推理的混合架构在精细语义、OOD鲁棒、可解释性与效率上均优于纯FM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉FMs虽具强迁移能力，但在需要显式关系推理（实体/角色/时空依赖）的任务上表现受限，如细粒度人类活动识别、第一视角视频理解、与多模态医学影像分析。实际应用强依赖空间、时间与语义依赖，迫切需要提升关系能力与可部署性。

Method: 提出“显式关系接口”的立场：以动态关系图作为中间表征，图的拓扑与边语义由输入与任务上下文自适应推断；用轻量、可适配的图推理模块增强FMs，在语义节点上稀疏推理，实现跨层次（部件-物体-场景；区域-器官）关系建模与多模态融合。

Result: 跨领域案例（人手物体操作动作识别、脑肿瘤分割）显示：在FM上加入动态图推理模块可提升细粒度语义一致性、OOD鲁棒性、可解释性，并降低计算、内存与硬件需求，相较FM基线更高效。

Conclusion: 倡议构建FM-图混合体的研究议程：1) 学习式动态图构建；2) 多层级关系推理；3) 跨模态关系融合；4) 面向结构化视觉任务、直接考查关系能力的评测协议。该路线在性能与资源效率间取得更优折中，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in
computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from
large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent
limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and
spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for
fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and
multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic
dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that
next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces,
instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge
semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this
position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation
action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs
with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves
fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness,
interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines.
Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also
achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under
practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for
FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level
relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or
region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols
that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.

Result: N/A

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) faces a major challenge when
dealing with illegible license plates (LPs). While reconstruction methods such
as super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these
low-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and
computational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to
cases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we
introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687
annotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span
a wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality
levels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and
LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and
illegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible
LPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image
recognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires
super-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which
remained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO),
together with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the
difficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research. The
proposed dataset is publicly available at
https://github.com/lmlwojcik/lplc-dataset.

*Aranya Saha,Tanvir Ahmed Khan,Ismam Nur Swapnil,Mohammad Ariful Haque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CLARIFY框架：用轻量皮肤病图像分类器（专家）+压缩对话式VLM（通才）并结合知识图谱检索，提升皮肤科VQA的准确性与效率。相较强基线，准确率+18%，VRAM和延迟分别降≥20%与≥5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用VLM虽具潜力，但在专业医疗诊断上准确性有限且推理成本高，难以临床部署。需要既可靠又高效的方案，将专业诊断能力与通用语言解释能力结合，并以可验证知识支撑，降低错误与计算资源消耗。

Method: 构建“专家-通才”层级体系：1) 专家：轻量、领域训练的皮肤病图像分类器，快速输出高精诊断候选；2) 通才：压缩后的对话式VLM，负责生成自然语言回答与解释；3) 专家输出作为引导信号，约束通才的推理路径；4) 知识图谱检索模块为通才提供可溯源的皮肤科事实支撑；5) 在自建多模态皮肤科数据集上训练与评估。

Result: 与最强基线（微调但未压缩的单线VLM）相比，CLARIFY诊断准确率提升18%；平均显存占用降低≥20%，推理时延降低≥5%。

Conclusion: 专家-通才协同、并以知识图谱强化的层级设计，可在保持或提升可解释性的同时显著提高准确性与效率，为构建轻量、可信、可临床落地的医疗VQA系统提供了有效范式。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential for medical
tasks; however, their general-purpose nature can limit specialized diagnostic
accuracy, and their large size poses substantial inference costs for real-world
clinical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a
Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering
(VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image
classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic
predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the
Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In
our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's
reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further
enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the
Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both
accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic
errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on
our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an
18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a
fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM
requirement and latency by at least 20\% and 5\%, respectively. These results
indicate that a Specialist-Generalist system provides a practical and powerful
paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI
systems.

Abstract: Face images play a crucial role in numerous applications; however, real-world
conditions frequently introduce degradations such as noise, blur, and
compression artifacts, affecting overall image quality and hindering subsequent
tasks. To address this challenge, we organized the VQualA 2025 Challenge on
Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) as part of the ICCV 2025 Workshops.
Participants created lightweight and efficient models (limited to 0.5 GFLOPs
and 5 million parameters) for the prediction of Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) on
face images with arbitrary resolutions and realistic degradations. Submissions
underwent comprehensive evaluations through correlation metrics on a dataset of
in-the-wild face images. This challenge attracted 127 participants, with 1519
final submissions. This report summarizes the methodologies and findings for
advancing the development of practical FIQA approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个上下文感知的零样本监控异常检测框架，融合TimeSformer+DPC+CLIP，并用InfoNCE/CPC联合训练与上下文门控，在无异常样本的情况下从时空与语义两方面检测未见过的异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监控异常事件稀少且难以标注，且强依赖场景上下文，传统有监督/仅时序或仅语义的方法泛化差；需要在不见异常样本的前提下，结合时序预测与语义理解进行零样本检测。

Method: - 视觉骨干：TimeSformer提取时空特征。
- 预测分支：DPC进行未来表示预测，利用预测偏差发现时序异常。
- 语义分支：CLIP + 场景特定文本提示，实现概念级异常识别（零样本）。
- 联合训练：InfoNCE用于对齐视觉与语义/时序表示，CPC用于对比式预测学习。
- 上下文门控：用场景线索或全局视频特征调制多分支输出，提升判别。

Result: 系统在复杂环境下对未见过行为具备更强泛化与检测能力（摘要未给出具体数据），代码已开源以复现。

Conclusion: 通过融合时序预测与视觉-语言语义，并加入上下文门控，实现了零样本监控异常检测中时序推理与语义上下文的统一，为无异常样本训练的实际部署提供可行路径。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to
their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel
context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal
events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed
hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal
dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to
extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future
representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based
semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through
context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using
InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic
representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by
modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By
integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system
can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This
framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in
zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has
been made available at

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene flow estimation is critical for autonomous systems to
navigate dynamic environments safely, but creating the necessary large-scale,
manually annotated datasets remains a significant bottleneck for developing
robust perception models. Current self-supervised methods struggle to match the
performance of fully supervised approaches, especially in challenging
long-range and adverse weather scenarios, while supervised methods are not
scalable due to their reliance on expensive human labeling. We introduce
DoGFlow, a novel self-supervised framework that recovers full 3D object motions
for LiDAR scene flow estimation without requiring any manual ground truth
annotations. This paper presents our cross-modal label transfer approach, where
DoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time directly from 4D radar
Doppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware
association and ambiguity-resolved propagation. On the challenging MAN
TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised
methods and improves label efficiency by enabling LiDAR backbones to achieve
over 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of the ground truth
data. For more details, please visit https://ajinkyakhoche.github.io/DogFlow/

*Zhangyu Jin,Andrew Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SatSkylines从卫星图像与粗几何先验出发，学习将带噪、插值的粗略体块转化为细致3D建筑，配合Skylines-50K大规模建筑资产数据集，实现高质量、可控且泛化性强的建筑重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仅凭俯视卫星图像，现有图像驱动3D生成难以恢复准确建筑结构；而细化方法又依赖高精度体素输入，无法从简单立方体等先验得到满意结果。需要一种既能利用简单几何引导又能生成高细节结构的方法。

Method: 提出SatSkylines：建模“从带噪插值的粗先验到细致几何”的变换，允许在不增加额外计算成本的前提下实现灵活几何控制；同时构建Skylines-50K数据集（5万+风格化、独特的3D建筑资产）以支撑细节化训练与生成。

Result: 在广泛评测中，方法能从卫星图+粗先验生成结构准确、细节丰富的建筑，并在不同场景和先验条件下展现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过将粗几何先验与卫星图像结合并学习细化变换，SatSkylines实现高质量、可控的3D建筑生成；Skylines-50K为该任务提供数据支撑，实验验证其有效与泛化性强。

Abstract: We present SatSkylines, a 3D building generation approach that takes
satellite imagery and coarse geometric priors. Without proper geometric
guidance, existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle to recover
accurate building structures from the top-down views of satellite images alone.
On the other hand, 3D detailization methods tend to rely heavily on highly
detailed voxel inputs and fail to produce satisfying results from simple priors
such as cuboids. To address these issues, our key idea is to model the
transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries,
enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. We
have further developed Skylines-50K, a large-scale dataset of over 50,000
unique and stylized 3D building assets in order to support the generations of
detailed building models. Extensive evaluations indicate the effectiveness of
our model and strong generalization ability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D动作RPG中，玩家依赖视觉线索寻找地图过渡点；自动映射与评估关卡提示需要客观可检测的过渡点标注与识别方法。现有工作缺少对“哪一个过渡点是关键路径上的主选项”的明确定义与算法，阻碍了导航辅助与关卡数据化分析。

Method: 提出单帧输入的两阶段管线：1) 用Faster R-CNN检测潜在STP；2) 用轻量MSTP选择器融合局部候选区域特征与全局场景特征进行排序，选出MSTP。两阶段均采用参数高效适配器（adapter）以便迁移；可选检索增强融合（利用相似样例）。构建来自五款ARPG的多样化自建数据集，并比较全网络微调与仅适配器迁移。

Result: 实验证明任务可行，基线达到合理性能。关键发现：数据充足时全量微调在STP检测上更优；低数据场景与MSTP选择任务中，仅适配器迁移更稳健、更有效。

Conclusion: 定义了新问题，提供基线方法与数据集，并给出关于高效适配的初步经验法则，为AI导航辅助与关卡设计评估工具奠基。

Abstract: In complex 3D game environments, players rely on visual affordances to spot
map transition points. Efficient identification of such points is important to
client-side auto-mapping, and provides an objective basis for evaluating map
cue presentation. In this work, we formalize the task of detecting traversable
Spatial Transition Points (STPs)-connectors between two sub regions-and
selecting the singular Main STP (MSTP), the unique STP that lies on the
designer-intended critical path toward the player's current macro-objective,
from a single game frame, proposing this as a new research focus. We introduce
a two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using
Faster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector that fuses
local and global visual features. Both stages benefit from parameter-efficient
adapters, and we further introduce an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step.
Our primary goal is to establish the feasibility of this problem and set
baseline performance metrics. We validate our approach on a custom-built,
diverse dataset collected from five Action RPG titles. Our experiments reveal a
key trade-off: while full-network fine-tuning produces superior STP detection
with sufficient data, adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and
effective in low-data scenarios and for the MSTP selection task. By defining
this novel problem, providing a baseline pipeline and dataset, and offering
initial insights into efficient model adaptation, we aim to contribute to
future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for audio-driven character animation
demonstrate promising performance for scenarios primarily involving speech and
singing. However, they often fall short in more complex film and television
productions, which demand sophisticated elements such as nuanced character
interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work. To address
this long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation, we
propose an audio-driven model, which we refere to as Wan-S2V, built upon Wan.
Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in
cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive
experiments, benchmarking our method against cutting-edge models such as
Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate
that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions.
Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications
in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出用于多模态癌症生存分析的DeReF框架：在“模态解耦—随机重组—动态MoE融合”流程中引入随机特征重组与区域交叉注意力，提升特征交互与泛化；在LC与TCGA数据上验证有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态生存预测多数先解耦模态特征再用固定融合（拼接/注意力）或MoE融合。问题：1）固定融合导致对预设特征组合过度依赖，难以动态适配；2）MoE中各专家仅处理各自解耦特征，信息彼此封闭，限制跨特征交互与表达能力。需要一种能打破固定组合、增强特征交互与泛化的融合机制。

Method: 提出DeReF框架：1）模态解耦模块+区域级交叉注意力，提升解耦特征的区位与跨模态表征质量；2）随机特征重组策略：在解耦与融合之间对不同模态/子空间的特征进行随机重排与组合，生成多粒度、多样性输入；3）动态MoE融合：在重组后的特征上用门控的混合专家进行自适应融合，允许专家间利用重组带来的跨特征信息流动。

Result: 在自建肝癌（LC）和三套TCGA公开数据上进行广泛实验，DeReF优于现有方法（未给出具体数值，但宣称多数据集一致提升），显示更好的泛化与表示能力。

Conclusion: 随机重组+动态MoE的DeReF打破固定融合与专家间信息封闭的问题，增强特征交互与泛化；区域交叉注意力进一步提升解耦表征质量。方法在多数据集上有效，代码将开源。

Abstract: Cancer survival analysis commonly integrates information across diverse
medical modalities to make survival-time predictions. Existing methods
primarily focus on extracting different decoupled features of modalities and
performing fusion operations such as concatenation, attention, and MoE-based
(Mixture-of-Experts) fusion. However, these methods still face two key
challenges: i) Fixed fusion schemes (concatenation and attention) can lead to
model over-reliance on predefined feature combinations, limiting the dynamic
fusion of decoupled features; ii) in MoE-based fusion methods, each expert
network handles separate decoupled features, which limits information
interaction among the decoupled features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion framework (DeReF), which
devises a random feature reorganization strategy between modalities decoupling
and dynamic MoE fusion modules.Its advantages are: i) it increases the
diversity of feature combinations and granularity, enhancing the generalization
ability of the subsequent expert networks; ii) it overcomes the problem of
information closure and helps expert networks better capture information among
decoupled features. Additionally, we incorporate a regional cross-attention
network within the modality decoupling module to improve the representation
quality of decoupled features. Extensive experimental results on our in-house
Liver Cancer (LC) and three widely used TCGA public datasets confirm the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出ROSE：以扩散Transformer为核心的视频修复/擦除框架，专门解决目标移除时的“副作用”（阴影、反射、光照影响、半透明、镜像），通过3D渲染合成成对数据进行监督，并发布ROSE-Bench评测。实验显示对比现有方法更优，且具备现实泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频目标移除多忽视或难以消除由目标引起的环境副作用（如阴影、反射等），主要因缺乏含有这些效果的成对监督视频数据，导致模型难以正确定位并修复受影响区域。

Method: 1) 数据：用3D渲染引擎构建全自动合成管线，生成大规模、场景/物体/机位/轨迹多样的配对视频（含与不含目标），并从差分掩膜提取副作用区域用于监督。2) 模型：以扩散Transformer为基础的视频修复模型，输入整段视频实现reference-based擦除，显式分支/损失预测并约束副作用区域；3) 训练与评测：在合成数据训练，并在新提出的ROSE-Bench（涵盖通用场景与五类副作用）评测。

Result: 在ROSE-Bench和真实视频上，相较现有视频对象擦除方法取得更优的定量与可视化表现；显示良好的跨域泛化能力，能更彻底移除阴影、反射、光照、半透明与镜像等副作用。

Conclusion: 通过合成成对数据与显式副作用监督，ROSE有效解决目标移除中的环境副作用难题；扩散Transformer全视频参考与副作用预测机制提升定位与修复质量。ROSE-Bench为该方向提供了标准化评测基准。

Abstract: Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent
success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects
of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to
eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.
This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework
that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be
categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency
and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the
aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data
generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data
preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,
objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an
video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all
object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for
reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to
explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed
through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate
the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new
benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five
special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results
demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video
object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios. The

TL;DR: 提出OwlCap视频字幕生成MLLM，通过自建HMD-270K数据集与新奖励CSER，解决现有方法在“运动-细节”表述失衡的问题，在细节与运动两类基准上显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频字幕模型常在运动信息与外观细节之间失衡，导致描述不完整，影响下游视频理解与生成的一致性。需要在数据与训练目标上同时约束，提升两者的平衡与覆盖。

Method: 双管齐下：1) 数据：构建HMD-270K，采用两阶段流程——Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF)融合与补全运动与细节信息；Fine-Grained Examination (FGE)细粒度审查确保标注质量与均衡。2) 优化：在GRPO框架上提出Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)，通过单元到集合匹配与双向校验，作为奖励引导生成同时覆盖运动与细节，提升完整性与准确性。基于HMD-270K做SFT，再用CSER进行GRPO后训练，得到OwlCap。

Result: 在两个基准上显著优于基线：细节导向的VDC上提升+4.2 Acc；运动导向的DREAM-1K上提升+4.6 F1，显示在运动与细节两方面的平衡改进。

Conclusion: 面向运动-细节失衡问题，数据构建与奖励优化相结合能有效提升视频字幕的完整性与一致性。OwlCap与HMD-270K将在社区开源，促进相关研究发展。

Abstract: Video captioning aims to generate comprehensive and coherent descriptions of
the video content, contributing to the advancement of both video understanding
and generation. However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail
imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the
other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a
lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this
issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed
the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage
pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2)
Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)
based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness
and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching
and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and
GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance.
Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements
compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2
Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap
model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research
community advancements.

Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBIs), play a crucial role in understanding ancient
Chinese civilization. The automated detection of OBIs from rubbing images
represents a fundamental yet challenging task in digital archaeology, primarily
due to various degradation factors including noise and cracks that limit the
effectiveness of conventional detection networks. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel clustering-based feature space representation learning
method. Our approach uniquely leverages the Oracle Bones Character (OBC) font
library dataset as prior knowledge to enhance feature extraction in the
detection network through clustering-based representation learning. The method
incorporates a specialized loss function derived from clustering results to
optimize feature representation, which is then integrated into the total
network loss. We validate the effectiveness of our method by conducting
experiments on two OBIs detection dataset using three mainstream detection
frameworks: Faster R-CNN, DETR, and Sparse R-CNN. Through extensive
experimentation, all frameworks demonstrate significant performance
improvements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出一种将信噪比(SNR)先验从空间域转到频率域的水下图像增强网络SFormer，通过谱域注意与频率自适应模块显著提升色彩、纹理与对比度，PSNR+3.1 dB、SSIM+0.08。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习式UIE常在空间域引入SNR先验以缓解波长相关衰减，但存在两大不足：无法有效分离跨通道干扰，且在放大有效结构、抑制噪声方面作用有限。因此需要一种能更好利用SNR并进行通道/频率选择性的机制。

Method: 在频域引入SNR先验：将特征分解为幅度与相位谱进行更精细的通道调制；提出Fourier Attention SNR-prior Transformer(FAST)，利用谱间交互与SNR线索强调关键频谱成分；设计Frequency Adaptive Transformer(FAT)瓶颈，用门控注意融合低/高频分支以提升感知质量；整体为U形架构，融合常规RGB流与SNR引导分支组成SFormer；在UIEB、EUVP、LSUI三数据集共4800对配对图像上训练。

Result: 相较近期方法，SFormer在PSNR上提升约3.1 dB、SSIM提升0.08，并在水下场景的颜色还原、纹理细节与对比度方面有更佳表现。

Conclusion: 频域SNR先验结合谱注意和频率自适应融合能有效应对水下成像的波长依赖衰减与噪声问题；U形双分支（RGB+SNR）设计带来稳健增强效果，在多数据集上证明了优越性。

Abstract: Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have
advanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks,
particularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce
wavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two
limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference,
and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while
suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the
frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for
better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior
Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight
key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT)
bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention
mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped
architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an
SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB,
EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and
0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in
underwater scenes.

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Automated segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium in
echocardiography videos is a key research area in cardiology. It aims to
provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection
Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good
segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation.
In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network
(\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation
accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception.
The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using
convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details,
while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture
spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame
and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation
when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only
multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the
Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context
through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate
EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.

TL;DR: 提出FPS：冻结特征编码器，仅在特征空间上搜索/优化分类超平面，解决UDA中的边界错配问题，兼具高效、可解释、可扩展，并在多模态与多领域基准上达SOTA或更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统UDA多依赖微调特征提取器，带来效率低、可解释性差、对大型/多模态模型扩展不佳的问题。作者观察到大规模预训练模型在特征空间呈现稳定的几何结构（类内聚类、类间分离），暗示域移主要是决策边界不对齐，而非特征退化，动机是利用这一定性发现以更轻量的方式校正边界。

Method: 提出Feature-space Planes Searcher (FPS)：冻结预训练编码器，离线抽取全数据特征；在特征空间中基于几何模式（类簇与间隔）优化分类决策边界（超平面），实现跨域对齐。该框架支持全数据一次性优化、内存/算力开销低，并便于解释适配过程。

Result: 在公开基准上，FPS达到与SOTA相当或更优的性能；能高效扩展到多模态大模型；在蛋白结构预测、遥感分类、地震检测等多种领域表现出良好适用性。

Conclusion: 域移的核心在于边界错配而非特征崩塌。通过冻结特征、仅优化特征空间决策边界，FPS提供了一个简单高效、可解释且通用的UDA范式，适合现代大模型与多领域迁移学习。

Abstract: Domain shift, characterized by degraded model performance during transition
from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, poses a persistent
challenge for deploying deep learning systems. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods predominantly rely on fine-tuning feature extractors -
an approach limited by inefficiency, reduced interpretability, and poor
scalability to modern architectures.
  Our analysis reveals that models pretrained on large-scale data exhibit
domain-invariant geometric patterns in their feature space, characterized by
intra-class clustering and inter-class separation, thereby preserving
transferable discriminative structures. These findings indicate that domain
shifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature
degradation.
  Unlike fine-tuning entire pre-trained models - which risks introducing
unpredictable feature distortions - we propose the Feature-space Planes
Searcher (FPS): a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision
boundaries by leveraging these geometric patterns while keeping the feature
encoder frozen. This streamlined approach enables interpretative analysis of
adaptation while substantially reducing memory and computational costs through
offline feature extraction, permitting full-dataset optimization in a single
computation cycle.
  Evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that FPS achieves competitive or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods. FPS scales efficiently with
multimodal large models and shows versatility across diverse domains including
protein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, and earthquake
detection. We anticipate FPS will provide a simple, effective, and
generalizable paradigm for transfer learning, particularly in domain adaptation
tasks. .

Motivation: N/A

Result: N/A

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in various
applications, including smart surveillance, healthcare, assistive technologies,
sports analytics, etc. However, HAR systems still face critical challenges,
including high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability
in real-time scenarios. An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is
introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and
a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first
extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which
captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained
localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled
using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based
genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA)
is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically
balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity
reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse
and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to
achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental
results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as
occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination,
demonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition
accuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time. The
lightweight and scalable nature of the HAR system supports real-time deployment
on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, enabling practical applications in
intelligent, resource-aware environments, including public safety, assistive
technology, and autonomous monitoring systems.

*Qun Ji,Peng Li,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ColorGS：在3D Gaussian Splatting基础上引入可学习的空间自适应颜色编码与增强形变模型，用于内镜下可变形组织的高保真重建，兼顾精细纹理与全局形变一致性，实时渲染并在多数据集SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有内镜视频重建在两方面受限：1) 3DGS固定每高斯单色，难以表达复杂纹理/光照与组织相似度下的细微色差；2) 线性/简单时变形形不足以建模手术场景中同时存在的局部组织变形与全局一致运动，导致重建失真与时空不一致。

Method: - Colored Gaussian Primitives：以动态锚点+可学习颜色参数实现空间自适应颜色编码，提升在复杂光照与相似组织纹理下的颜色表达力。
- Enhanced Deformation Model (EDM)：融合时间感知的高斯基函数与可学习的时间无关形变项，既捕捉局部组织细节变形，又维持由手术交互引起的全局运动一致性。
- 基于3DGS框架，保持实时渲染效率。

Result: 在达芬奇手术视频与EndoNeRF、StereoMIS基准上达SOTA：PSNR 39.85（较3DGS系方法+1.5dB），SSIM 97.25%，同时维持实时渲染。

Conclusion: ColorGS通过自适应颜色与增强形变联合建模，有效提升手术场景的动态重建保真度与时空一致性，并保持计算可行性，适用于术中导航与AR/VR应用。

Abstract: High-fidelity reconstruction of deformable tissues from endoscopic videos
remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing
subtle color variations and modeling global deformations. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed
per-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear
deformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address
these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially
adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene
reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ
dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially
varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex
lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model
(EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable
time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized
tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical
interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and
benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves
state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior
3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\%) while maintaining real-time
rendering efficiency. Our work advances surgical scene reconstruction by
balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, critical for
intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.

*Hiroaki Aizawa,Yuta Naito,Kohei Fukuda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出“按类泛洪正则化”（class-wise flooding），在类别不平衡下为每个类别设置不同的泛洪阈值以抑制多数类过拟合、保护少数类学习，从而提升少数类与整体泛化表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类别不平衡导致模型偏向多数类，少数类识别显著下降；传统泛洪对所有样本统一阈值，可能过度抑制少数类学习或不足以抑制多数类过拟合，亟需能按类别差异调控的正则化。

Method: 扩展“泛洪正则化”到类别层面：为每个类别根据其频次分配类特定的泛洪水平（阈值）。训练时限制各类别训练损失不低于其对应阈值，从而对多数类更强抑制、对少数类更宽松。用于不平衡图像分类任务进行验证。

Result: 相较统一阈值的传统泛洪，所提方法在少数类分类性能上有提升，同时整体泛化效果更好。

Conclusion: 类级泛洪通过频次感知的阈值分配在不平衡数据上有效缓解多数类过拟合、改善少数类性能，优于常规泛洪，提升整体泛化。

Abstract: The purpose of training neural networks is to achieve high generalization
performance on unseen inputs. However, when trained on imbalanced datasets, a
model's prediction tends to favor majority classes over minority classes,
leading to significant degradation in the recognition performance of minority
classes. To address this issue, we propose class-wise flooding regularization,
an extension of flooding regularization applied at the class level. Flooding is
a regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by preventing the
training loss from falling below a predefined threshold, known as the flooding
level, thereby discouraging memorization. Our proposed method assigns a
class-specific flooding level based on class frequencies. By doing so, it
suppresses overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning
for minority classes. We validate our approach on imbalanced image
classification. Compared to conventional flooding regularizations, our method
improves the classification performance of minority classes and achieves better
overall generalization.

### [28] [Flatness-aware Curriculum Learning via Adversarial Difficulty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18726)

TL;DR: N/A


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: N/A

Method: N/A

Result: N/A

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Neural networks trained by empirical risk minimization often suffer from
overfitting, especially to specific samples or domains, which leads to poor
generalization. Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this issue by selecting
training samples based on the difficulty. From the optimization perspective,
methods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improve robustness and
generalization by seeking flat minima. However, combining CL with SAM is not
straightforward. In flat regions, both the loss values and the gradient norms
tend to become uniformly small, which makes it difficult to evaluate sample
difficulty and design an effective curriculum. To overcome this problem, we
propose the Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM), which quantifies adversarial
vulnerability by leveraging the robustness properties of models trained toward
flat minima. Unlike loss- or gradient-based measures, which become ineffective
as training progresses into flatter regions, ADM remains informative by
measuring the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. We
incorporate ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample
difficulty. We evaluated our approach on image classification tasks,
fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization. The results demonstrate
that our method preserves the strengths of both CL and SAM while outperforming
existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies.

### [29] [Are All Marine Species Created Equal? Performance Disparities in Underwater Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18729)
*Melanie Wille,Tobias Fischer,Scarlett Raine*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究水下目标检测中类别不均衡与视觉特性导致的类别性能差异，区分定位与分类环节，发现前景-背景判别是主要瓶颈；即便数据均衡，分类精度差距仍在，建议根据精确率/召回率目标选择不均衡/均衡分布，并将改进重点放在定位模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像受退化、噪声与目标外观差异影响，许多物种检测效果不一致。既有工作多归因数据量或类别不平衡，但缺乏对“除数据量外”的成因剖析与针对性改进策略，尤其是对表现欠佳类别（如扇贝）的系统性诊断。

Method: 在DUO数据集上人为分离检测流程：1）定位环节：用YOLO11并借助TIDE误差分解评估各阶段错误来源；2）分类环节：控制/平衡类别分布，隔离数据量因素，分析精度与召回变化；重点考察扇贝类别的失效模式与特征可分性。

Result: 定位端：无论数据量多少，前景-背景区分错误最突出。分类端：在类别均衡后，精度差距依旧，说明存在内在的特征难度与跨类依赖，而非单纯的数据稀缺。扇贝类持续欠佳。

Conclusion: 实践建议：若重视精确率可维持不均衡分布，若重视召回则采用均衡分布。研究建议：优先改进定位模块（前景-背景判别、区域提议/锚框品质等），同时针对难类探索更强的特征表达。代码与数据已公开。

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but
poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class
distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is
detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key
research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific
performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of
under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the
object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the
under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and
TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic
stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent
precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based
challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend
imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced
distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes
should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules.
We publicly release our code and datasets.

TL;DR: 将2D工程矢量图转为参数化CAD序列。提出Drawing2CAD：以序列到序列方式，从矢量图元预测CAD命令和参数；用双解码器Transformer与软目标损失；并发布配对数据集CAD-VGDrawing与代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业CAD流程常从2D工程图出发，但现有生成方法多基于点云/网格/文本，脱离传统流程。缺少自动把2D矢量工程图转换为可编辑的参数化CAD模型的研究，这是工程设计关键环节。

Method: 将任务表述为seq2seq：输入为保留精确几何信息的“网络友好”矢量图元表示；模型为双解码器Transformer，一支解码命令类型，另一支解码对应的参数，并保持一一对应；训练使用软目标分布损失以容纳CAD参数的多解与容差。构建CAD-VGDrawing数据集（配对工程图—参数化CAD），用于训练与评测。

Result: 在CAD-VGDrawing上进行全面实验，证明方法在从2D图到参数化CAD生成上的有效性（优于基线/具备更高精度与保持设计意图），代码与数据集开源。

Conclusion: 将2D矢量工程图到参数化CAD的自动化生成可行且有效。通过精确图元表示、双解码器及软目标损失，能更好保留几何精度与设计意图；数据集与开源资源为后续研究提供基础。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant
innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable
progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds,
meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge
from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings.
The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings
remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To
address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly
inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric
precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose
Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a
network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise
geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples
command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence,
and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility
in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing,
a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct
thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/lllssc/Drawing2CAD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种路由器门控的跨模态融合，用音频腐蚀分数按token自适应重加权，在嘈杂环境下显著降低AVSR词错率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AVSR在噪声中难以可靠评估音频质量，不能在解码时动态调节对音频/视频的依赖，导致鲁棒性差。

Method: 引入“基于音视特征融合的路由器”（router），计算每个token的声学腐蚀分数，作为门控信号在解码器各层执行跨模态（音→视）注意力的加权：下调不可靠的音频token贡献，增强视觉线索；层层动态重分配模态权重。并在LRS3上实现与AV-HuBERT对比及消融。

Result: 在LRS3上相对AV-HuBERT实现16.51%到42.67%的相对词错率下降；消融显示路由器与门控两者均带来稳健性提升，尤其在真实噪声条件下。

Conclusion: 基于token级腐蚀评分的路由门控跨模态融合能在噪声下自适应转向视觉，提高AVSR鲁棒性，相比强基线显著降错；路由与门控机制均为关键组件。

Abstract: Robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments remains
challenging, as existing systems struggle to estimate audio reliability and
dynamically adjust modality reliance. We propose router-gated cross-modal
feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and
visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an
audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable
audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each
decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when
audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach
achieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to
AV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism
contribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.

### [32] [Rethinking Human-Object Interaction Evaluation for both Vision-Language Models and HOI-Specific Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18753)
*Qinqian Lei,Bo Wang,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个新的HOI检测评测基准，将任务改为多答案多选题，避免因语义歧义而惩罚有效预测，从而公平比较通用生成式VLM与专门HOI方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI基准（如HICO-DET）要求与标注HOI类别精确匹配，不适配生成式VLM的多样表达。在图像含有动作歧义（如“抛”“接”飞盘）时，合理但未被标注的预测会被判错，既影响VLM也影响HOI专用方法的评估公正性。需要一个能同时容纳通用VLM与专用HOI方法的统一评测。

Method: 将HOI检测重述为“多答案-多选题”设置：每个问题仅包含真实的正选项与经过策划的负选项；负选项避免与标注正例语义近邻（如已标注“接”时不把“抛”列为负），以减少歧义带来的误罚。基准与协议允许直接评估通用生成式VLM和专用HOI模型。

Result: 该评测协议成为首个同时适配VLM与HOI方法的基准，支持对两类方法进行直接、公平的对比，并揭示当前HOI理解进展的新观察（摘要未给出具体数值）。

Conclusion: 通过消除由精确匹配带来的不公平惩罚，新基准更贴合生成式VLM的输出特性，促进对HOI理解能力的客观比较与评估，为未来模型设计与训练提供更可靠的测量工具。

Abstract: Prior human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods have integrated early
vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, but only as supporting components
within their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs
suggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand
images involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can
general-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do
they compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark
that can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as
HICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their
evaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is
poorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple
valid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may
capture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted
as either "throwing" or "catching". When only "catching" is annotated, the
other, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact
matching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,
affecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid
predictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a
multiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only
ground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are
constructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when "catching" is annotated, "throwing"
is not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The
proposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI
methods, enabling direct comparison and offering new insight into the current
state of progress in HOI understanding.

TL;DR: 提出CmOS框架，用多模态CoT与RAG生成含视觉选项的教育类选择题，并通过判别模块甄别适合视觉化的内容；实验显示在内容判别、题目与视觉选项生成上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCQ生成多聚焦文本选项，忽视视觉选项；高质量干扰项人工编写成本高、难扩展。需要一种能自动生成语义可信、视觉相似的答案与干扰项的方法，并判断何时适合用视觉选项。

Method: 提出Cross-modal Options Synthesis (CmOS)：1) 多模态Chain-of-Thought推理，提升题干与选项的一致性与可解释性；2) 检索增强生成（RAG），引入外部知识与视觉素材以确保语义与视觉相关性；3) 判别模块，自动识别适合视觉化呈现的知识点/题目；4) 生成语义合理且视觉相似的正确答案与干扰项（图像选项）。

Result: 在多学科、多教育层级的测试任务上，CmOS在三个维度（内容判别、题目生成、视觉选项生成）均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 整合MCoT与RAG并加入判别模块，可有效自动化生成含视觉选项的高质量MCQ，兼顾语义可信度与视觉相似性，具有可扩展性与应用潜力。

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a crucial role in fostering deep
thinking and knowledge integration in education. However, previous research has
primarily focused on generating MCQs with textual options, but it largely
overlooks the visual options. Moreover, generating high-quality distractors
remains a major challenge due to the high cost and limited scalability of
manual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Options
Synthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual
options. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning
process and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically
plausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a
discrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options.
Experimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in
content discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over
existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.

Abstract: The growing integration of smart environments and low-power computing
devices, coupled with mass-market sensor technologies, is driving advancements
in remote and non-contact physiological monitoring. However, deploying these
systems in real-time on resource-constrained platforms introduces significant
challenges related to scalability, interoperability, and performance. This
paper presents a real-time remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) system optimized
for low-power devices, designed to extract physiological signals, such as heart
rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2), from facial
video streams. The system is built on the Face2PPG pipeline, which processes
video frames sequentially for rPPG signal extraction and analysis, while
leveraging a multithreaded architecture to manage video capture, real-time
processing, network communication, and graphical user interface (GUI) updates
concurrently. This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames
per second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface
to guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both
an HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand
vital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of
low-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional
Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven
processing and efficient task parallelization. The system is evaluated under
real-time constraints, demonstrating robustness while minimizing computational
overhead. Our work addresses key challenges in real-time biosignal monitoring,
offering practical solutions for optimizing performance in modern healthcare
and human-computer interaction applications.

TL;DR: 提出PseudoMapTrainer：用从未标注多摄像头数据生成的伪标注来训练在线矢量地图模型，无需昂贵HD地图真值；并支持大规模半监督预训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线地图生成方法在训练时依赖高精度HD地图标注，采集昂贵、地域覆盖不足、泛化性差；需要一种能利用海量未标注传感器数据、降低成本并提升泛化的方法。

Method: 1) 伪标注生成：利用多摄像头影像进行高斯点云/高斯splatting重建路表；结合预训练2D语义分割得到语义约束，从重建中提取道路几何与拓扑；2) Mask-aware分配与损失：针对伪标注的部分缺失/遮挡，引入掩膜感知的目标分配与损失设计，避免将未观测区域当负样本；3) 训练策略：完全无真值训练在线矢量地图模型；亦可在半监督框架下用伪标注对模型进行大规模预训练，再用少量真值微调。

Result: 在无任何HD地图真值的情况下成功训练在线映射模型，且在半监督设定下通过大规模未标注数据预训练显著提升性能与泛化（论文未给出具体数值于摘要，但宣称可有效利用众包数据）。

Conclusion: PseudoMapTrainer消除了对昂贵HD地图真值的依赖，通过基于高斯splatting与语义分割的伪标注生成和掩膜感知训练，首次实现纯伪标注的在线地图训练，并为半监督、大规模众包数据预训练提供有效路径。

Abstract: Online mapping models show remarkable results in predicting vectorized maps
from multi-view camera images only. However, all existing approaches still rely
on ground-truth high-definition maps during training, which are expensive to
obtain and often not geographically diverse enough for reliable generalization.
In this work, we propose PseudoMapTrainer, a novel approach to online mapping
that uses pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled sensor data. We derive those
pseudo-labels by reconstructing the road surface from multi-camera imagery
using Gaussian splatting and semantics of a pre-trained 2D segmentation
network. In addition, we introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss
function to handle partially masked pseudo-labels, allowing for the first time
the training of online mapping models without any ground-truth maps.
Furthermore, our pseudo-labels can be effectively used to pre-train an online
model in a semi-supervised manner to leverage large-scale unlabeled
crowdsourced data. The code is available at
github.com/boschresearch/PseudoMapTrainer.

Abstract: Effective waste sorting is critical for sustainable recycling, yet AI
research in this domain continues to lag behind commercial systems due to
limited datasets and reliance on legacy object detectors. In this work, we
advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and
introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first
benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on
the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts
perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy.
Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern
transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then
propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using
spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised
training. Applied to the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, our pseudo-annotations
achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring
the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the
research community by establishing rigorous baselines, introducing a robust
ensemble-based pseudo-labeling pipeline, generating high-quality annotations
for the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, and systematically evaluating OVOD models
under real-world waste sorting conditions. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Different font styles (i.e., font shapes) convey distinct impressions,
indicating a close relationship between font shapes and word tags describing
those impressions. This paper proposes a novel embedding method for impression
tags that leverages these shape-impression relationships. For instance, our
method assigns similar vectors to impression tags that frequently co-occur in
order to represent impressions of fonts, whereas standard word embedding
methods (e.g., BERT and CLIP) yield very different vectors. This property is
particularly useful for impression-based font generation and font retrieval.
Technically, we construct a graph whose nodes represent impression tags and
whose edges encode co-occurrence relationships. Then, we apply spectral
embedding to obtain the impression vectors for each tag. We compare our method
with BERT and CLIP in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating
that our approach performs better in impression-guided font generation.

*Takayuki Ishikawa,Carmelo Bonannella,Bas J. W. Lerink,Marc Rußwurm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 用公开的遥感时间序列预训练模型在荷兰树种分类上进行微调，结合Sentinel-1/2、ERA5与SRTM数据，相比传统随机森林+手工特征方法，准确率提升最高达10%，表明深度特征在少标注情境下显著优于手工谐波特征，可有效用于NFI更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 国家森林清查（NFI）更新昂贵且低频，而树种分布对管理至关重要。现有利用卫星时间序列+随机森林的做法依赖手工特征与物候指标，表达能力受限。遥感领域出现的通用预训练“基础模型”可在海量无标注数据上学得通用表征，并以较少标注高效迁移。作者旨在检验：在标注稀缺、任务为树种分类的NFI应用中，深度预训练特征能否系统性提升性能、取代或补充传统手工特征。

Method: - 数据：基于GEE提取Sentinel-1（雷达）、Sentinel-2（光学）、ERA5（气象再分析）与SRTM（地形）时间序列/辅助变量，用于荷兰树种样本。
- 模型：采用公开的遥感时间序列基础模型（预训练）作为特征提取器，并在少量标注上进行微调；与基线的随机森林+手工谐波/物候特征进行对比。
- 评估：在多数据组合与少标注设定下，比较分类准确率等指标，检验深度特征对NFI树种分类的增益。

Result: 微调预训练的遥感时间序列基础模型在所有数据集设置上均优于当前SOTA，准确率提升可达约10%。深度时序特征对树冠季节反射/后向散射模式的表征更充分，融合多源数据（S1/S2/ERA5/SRTM）带来稳健增益。

Conclusion: 手工谐波与物候特征对复杂树种判别不足；深度预训练时间序列表征在少标注NFI任务中更有效。利用公开卫星数据与基础模型可显著提升NFI树种分类，降低外业成本并提高更新频率，能作为现有森林清查流程的有力补充。

Abstract: National Forest Inventory (NFI)s serve as the primary source of forest
information, providing crucial tree species distribution data. However,
maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns.
Remote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning,
offer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While
the use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing
tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches
rely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and
phenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained
remote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These
pre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for
general-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with
smaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work
systematically investigates how deep features improve tree species
classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise,
we extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites
data and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that
fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model
outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the
Netherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This
demonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for
this task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for
data-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly
available satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly
improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can
effectively complement existing forest inventory processes.

Abstract: This paper presents our solution for the MIDOG 2025 Challenge Track 2, which
focuses on binary classification of normal mitotic figures (NMFs) versus
atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) in histopathological images. Our approach
leverages a ConvNeXt V2 base model with center cropping preprocessing and
5-fold cross-validation ensemble strategy. The method addresses key challenges
including severe class imbalance, high morphological variability, and domain
heterogeneity across different tumor types, species, and scanners. Through
strategic preprocessing with 60% center cropping and mixed precision training,
our model achieved robust performance on the diverse MIDOG 2025 dataset. The

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary, low-intensity, and short-duration
facial expressions that often reveal an individual's genuine thoughts and
emotions. Most existing ME analysis methods rely on window-level classification
with fixed window sizes and hard decisions, which limits their ability to
capture the complex temporal dynamics of MEs. Although recent approaches have
adopted video-level regression frameworks to address some of these challenges,
interval decoding still depends on manually predefined, window-based methods,
leaving the issue only partially mitigated. In this paper, we propose a
prior-guided video-level regression method for ME analysis. We introduce a
scalable interval selection strategy that comprehensively considers the
temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics of MEs,
enabling precise spotting of the onset, apex, and offset phases. In addition,
we introduce a synergistic optimization framework, in which the spotting and
recognition tasks share parameters except for the classification heads. This
fully exploits complementary information, makes more efficient use of limited
data, and enhances the model's capability. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with an STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)$^3$ and 0.2000 on SAMMLV. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个基于图像处理与几何建模的客观评分框架，能自动检测并量化显微血管吻合中的错误，评分与专家一致性高，用于更高效可靠的培训与评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显微吻合评估常依赖主观量表（如anastomosis lapse index），存在偏差与低效率，难以客观、可重复地判断学员能力。

Method: 收集来自多家医院、不同水平参与者的三套数据；对吻合图像进行图像处理，构建错误的几何表征（如偏移、间距、角度、缝线/针脚位置等），建立错误检测与量化评分机制，将几何度量映射为分数，并与专家评分进行对比。

Result: 几何度量与专家评分高度一致，对文中纳入的错误类型可有效复现专家打分；显示该方法在效率与可靠性方面优于人工主观评价。

Conclusion: 基于几何建模与图像处理的客观评估框架可用于显微吻合训练与考核，提升评分一致性与效率，并为改进培训方案提供依据。

Abstract: Microsurgical anastomosis demands exceptional dexterity and visuospatial
skills, underscoring the importance of comprehensive training and precise
outcome assessment. Currently, methods such as the outcome-oriented anastomosis
lapse index are used to evaluate this procedure. However, they often rely on
subjective judgment, which can introduce biases that affect the reliability and
efficiency of the assessment of competence. Leveraging three datasets from
hospitals with participants at various levels, we introduce a quantitative
framework that uses image-processing techniques for objective assessment of
microsurgical anastomoses. The approach uses geometric modeling of errors along
with a detection and scoring mechanism, enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of microsurgical proficiency assessment and advancing training
protocols. The results show that the geometric metrics effectively replicate
expert raters' scoring for the errors considered in this work.

### [42] [Harnessing Meta-Learning for Controllable Full-Frame Video Stabilization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18859)
*Muhammad Kashif Ali,Eun Woo Im,Dongjin Kim,Tae Hyun Kim,Vivek Gupta,Haonan Luo,Tianrui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种在测试时快速自适应的像素级视频稳像方法：利用推理阶段的低层视觉线索进行一次或少次自适应更新，并通过“抖动（jerk）定位+定向自适应”只在高抖段进行优化，从而在保持全帧合成优势下超过传统SOTA稳像，且提供类似经典方法的用户控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全帧像素级稳像方法尽管效果好，但在不同视频的运动模式与内容多样性下，用固定参数难以稳健泛化；同时推理时可获得的低层视觉线索未被充分利用。目标是在不牺牲全帧输出的前提下，提升稳像稳定度与视觉质量，并减少适配开销。

Method: 1) 测试时快速自适应（test-time adaptation）：对给定输入视频，基于推理时的低层视觉线索对模型进行一次或少量更新，提高当前视频上的稳像与合成质量。2) 抖动定位模块（jerk localization）：检测时间轴上高“jerk”（加速度变化大）的片段。3) 定向自适应策略：仅对高抖片段进行针对性参数更新，降低适配步数与过拟合风险。4) 框架可作为插件应用于多种全帧合成稳像器。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上进行广泛实验，定性与定量均提升，且对多种全帧合成模型都有一致增益；单次适配即可显著提高稳定性与视觉质量；在下游任务上亦有改善；整体性能超过长期占优的SOTA传统稳像方法。

Conclusion: 测试时快速自适应结合抖动定位与定向自适应，能有效弥补全帧像素级稳像在跨视频泛化上的不足，兼顾稳定性、视觉质量与效率，同时保持全帧输出和提供用户可控性，具有通用性与实用价值。

Abstract: Video stabilization remains a fundamental problem in computer vision,
particularly pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization, which
synthesize full-frame outputs, add to the complexity of this task. These
methods aim to enhance stability while synthesizing full-frame videos, but the
inherent diversity in motion profiles and visual content present in each video
sequence makes robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. To
address this, we present a novel method that improves pixel-level synthesis
video stabilization methods by rapidly adapting models to each input video at
test time. The proposed approach takes advantage of low-level visual cues
available during inference to improve both the stability and visual quality of
the output. Notably, the proposed rapid adaptation achieves significant
performance gains even with a single adaptation pass. We further propose a jerk
localization module and a targeted adaptation strategy, which focuses the
adaptation on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation
steps. The proposed methodology enables modern stabilizers to overcome the
longstanding SOTA approaches while maintaining the full frame nature of the
modern methods, while offering users with control mechanisms akin to classical
approaches. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate
the versatility of the proposed method. Our approach consistently improves the
performance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and
quantitative terms, including results on downstream applications.

### [43] [Toward Robust Medical Fairness: Debiased Dual-Modal Alignment via Text-Guided Attribute-Disentangled Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18886)
*Yuexuan Xia,Benteng Ma,Jiang He,Zhiyong Wang,Qi Dou,Yong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DualFairVL：一种面向医疗影像诊断的多模态提示学习框架，同时在视觉与文本两侧去偏并对齐跨模态表示，在8个数据集与多分布条件下实现SOTA的公平性与准确性，仅需3.6M可训练参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗诊断需在不同人群（人口统计学分组）间保持公平，现实中存在由设备差异、临床流程等导致的分布偏移。现有VLM去偏方法多单独处理视觉或文本，造成跨模态错配与残余不公平，因此需要一个联合处理、能在分布外泛化的去偏与对齐方法。

Method: - 设计DualFairVL并行双分支：将敏感属性与目标任务属性解耦，各自学习但保持跨模态对齐。
- 构造“近正交”的文本锚（通过线性投影），用作跨注意力的引导，融合视觉与文本特征。
- 引入超网络进一步解耦属性相关信息，生成实例自适应的视觉提示，编码跨模态线索以提升公平与鲁棒。
- 在视觉分支使用原型正则：分离敏感特征、强化与文本锚的对齐。
- 整体为参数高效训练（约3.6M参数），对比全量微调与PEFT基线。

Result: 在8个医疗影像数据集、覆盖4种模态中，DualFairVL在分布内与分布外评测均取得SOTA：同时提高公平性（跨人群性能差异减小）与准确性，优于全量微调和多种参数高效基线。

Conclusion: 联合去偏与跨模态对齐是提升医疗VLM公平性与泛化的关键。DualFairVL通过双分支、正交文本锚、超网络与原型正则实现参数高效的公平与鲁棒性提升，适合在存在设备/实践差异的临床环境部署；代码将开源以促进复现。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis is essential
for equitable healthcare, particularly under distribution shifts caused by
variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice. Vision-language models
(VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity
attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive
directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and
text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and
fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal
prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal
representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that
separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned
representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are
constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to
produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related
information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode
dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is
applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and
strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves
state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution
settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with
only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.

*Zhehao Li,Chong Wang,Yi Chen,Yinghao Lu,Jiangbo Qian,Jiong Wang,Jiafei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DQEN用于DETR式HOI检测，通过增强对象查询和交互查询（借助对象感知编码特征与CLIP语义融合），并加入辅助预测单元，显著提升HICO-Det与V-COCO性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DETR类HOI检测依赖查询质量，但以往多用随机初始化导致表示含糊；HOI中“人”固定而“物体/交互”多变，需要分别增强对象与交互查询以更精准地定位与识别。

Method: 1) 对象查询增强：利用object-aware encoder特征引导对象查询聚焦于与人交互的目标；2) 交互查询增强：提出Interaction Semantic Fusion，将CLIP促成的HOI候选与语义特征融合以初始化交互查询；3) 辅助预测单元：用于强化交互特征表征；整体在DETR框架下端到端训练。

Result: 在HICO-Det与V-COCO上取得有竞争力的SOTA或接近SOTA结果（摘要未给具体数值），证明方法有效。

Conclusion: 通过双重查询增强与语义融合，缓解随机查询带来的表示模糊问题，提升HOI定位与交互识别能力；方法通用、可复现（代码开源）。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection focuses on localizing human-object
pairs and recognizing their interactions. Recently, the DETR-based framework
has been widely adopted in HOI detection. In DETR-based HOI models, queries
with clear meaning are crucial for accurately detecting HOIs. However, prior
works have typically relied on randomly initialized queries, leading to vague
representations that limit the model's effectiveness. Meanwhile, humans in the
HOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable.
Therefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object
and interaction queries. Specifically, object queries are enhanced with
object-aware encoder features, enabling the model to focus more effectively on
humans interacting with objects in an object-aware way. On the other hand, we
design a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates
that are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance
the initialization of interaction queries, thereby improving the model's
ability to understand interactions. Furthermore, we introduce an Auxiliary
Prediction Unit aimed at improving the representation of interaction features.
Our proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the HICO-Det and
the V-COCO datasets. The source code is available at
https://github.com/lzzhhh1019/DQEN.

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles.
Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data,
interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban
scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with
non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind
AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability
while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we
propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by
generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us
to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We
conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and
validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our
approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions,
yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular,
non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA
Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route
completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

Abstract: The Event-Enriched Image Analysis (EVENTA) Grand Challenge, hosted at ACM
Multimedia 2025, introduces the first large-scale benchmark for event-level
multimodal understanding. Traditional captioning and retrieval tasks largely
focus on surface-level recognition of people, objects, and scenes, often
overlooking the contextual and semantic dimensions that define real-world
events. EVENTA addresses this gap by integrating contextual, temporal, and
semantic information to capture the who, when, where, what, and why behind an
image. Built upon the OpenEvents V1 dataset, the challenge features two tracks:
Event-Enriched Image Retrieval and Captioning, and Event-Based Image Retrieval.
A total of 45 teams from six countries participated, with evaluation conducted
through Public and Private Test phases to ensure fairness and reproducibility.
The top three teams were invited to present their solutions at ACM Multimedia
2025. EVENTA establishes a foundation for context-aware, narrative-driven
multimedia AI, with applications in journalism, media analysis, cultural
archiving, and accessibility. Further details about the challenge are available

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 群体与个体行人在空间占用与交互行为上存在差异，但缺乏可扩展的数据驱动识别与系统化度量框架，限制了对人群动力学、仿真与空间设计验证的深入研究。

Method: 1) 将轨迹按固定时间窗分段；2) 采用基于Transformer的pair分类模型，通过序列化的过滤流程识别凝聚的群体并分离单行人；3) 构建度量框架：空间维度（凸包面积、最小包围圆半径、热力图密度等）；行为维度（速度变化、运动角偏差、净空半径、轨迹直线度等）；4) 定义遭遇类型学：单-单、单-群、群-群；5) 在不同序列长度（60/100/200帧）上实现可扩展的数据与流程。

Result: 当前版本主要完成分类管线与数据结构化，成功区分群体与个体并搭建度量与类型学框架；尚未给出完整的定量结果。

Conclusion: 该工作为跨序列长度的可扩展分析奠定基础；后续将补充对提出指标的全面量化、并探讨其在行人仿真与空间设计验证中的意义与应用。

Abstract: This study presents an initial framework for distinguishing group and single
pedestrians based on real-world trajectory data, with the aim of analyzing
their differences in space utilization and emergent behavioral patterns. By
segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a
Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and
isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process.
To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework
incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization
metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and
heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types
occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change,
motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are
designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions.
Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single,
single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different
interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the
classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork
for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200
frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the
proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space
design validation in crowd dynamics research.

TL;DR: 提出一种多尺度弱监督语义分割框架，把水下影像中的细粒度生态信息迁移到无人机航拍影像，实现大范围、低标注成本的珊瑚礁形态类型（morphotypes）制图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大范围监测珊瑚礁对生态评估与保护至关重要，但无人机影像分辨率不足以区分细粒度类别，且为大面积数据做像素级标注成本高，限制了传统深度分割方法的可扩展性。

Method: 构建多尺度弱监督分割流程：以水下影像提供细粒度生态信息，通过与航拍影像跨尺度对齐与信息迁移；使用基于分类的监督信号替代密集标注；结合空间插值扩展稀疏标签；引入自蒸馏提升模型一致性与泛化；支持在航拍数据上进行大范围分割并可灵活加入新类别。

Result: 在无人机影像上实现大范围的珊瑚形态类型分割，表现出有效性与可扩展性，且能较少人工标注量；展示了对新增类别的集成能力。

Conclusion: 该方法以低成本数据采集与弱监督深度学习相结合，提供了一条可扩展的高分辨率珊瑚礁监测途径，适用于大范围生态制图与长期监测。

Abstract: Monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales remains an open challenge,
essential for assessing ecosystem health and informing conservation efforts.
While drone-based aerial imagery offers broad spatial coverage, its limited
resolution makes it difficult to reliably distinguish fine-scale classes, such
as coral morphotypes. At the same time, obtaining pixel-level annotations over
large spatial extents is costly and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability
of deep learning-based segmentation methods for aerial imagery. We present a
multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that addresses
this challenge by transferring fine-scale ecological information from
underwater imagery to aerial data. Our method enables large-scale coral reef
mapping from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation, combining
classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation and self-distillation
techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, enabling large-area
segmentation of coral morphotypes and demonstrating flexibility for integrating
new classes. This study presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for
high-resolution reef monitoring, combining low-cost data collection, weakly
supervised deep learning and multi-scale remote sensing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统制图依赖GIS，操作门槛高、流程耗时，尤其在重复任务上效率低。现有生成式AI虽能合成图像，但在空间结构与语义布局的可控性不足，难以生成准确地图，因而需要一种既能保证地理准确性又能实现风格化与自动化的方案。

Method: 将矢量地理数据作为结构约束，引导图像扩散模型按用户文本提示生成不同风格的地图；在系统层面做成一个网页应用以降低使用门槛；并通过专业制图师的用户研究评估生成地图的保真度、应用可用性与GenAI在制图中的影响。

Result: 模型可生成在空间构成与语义布局上更准确、风格可控的地图；网页应用提高了可用性与可及性；用户研究表明该方法对非专家与专业人员都能提升制图效率与质量。

Conclusion: 融合矢量数据的扩散模型能有效推进AI辅助制图的可行性与实用性；系统在实际工作流中具潜力。作者提出未来需继续改进技术细节，并重新定位制图师在AI时代的角色，以共同推进AI辅助制图范式。

Abstract: Traditional map-making relies heavily on Geographic Information Systems
(GIS), requiring domain expertise and being time-consuming, especially for
repetitive tasks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI), particularly image
diffusion models, offer new opportunities for automating and democratizing the
map-making process. However, these models struggle with accurate map creation
due to limited control over spatial composition and semantic layout. To address
this, we integrate vector data to guide map generation in different styles,
specified by the textual prompts. Our model is the first to generate accurate
maps in controlled styles, and we have integrated it into a web application to
improve its usability and accessibility. We conducted a user study with
professional cartographers to assess the fidelity of generated maps, the
usability of the web application, and the implications of ever-emerging GenAI
in map-making. The findings have suggested the potential of our developed
application and, more generally, the GenAI models in helping both non-expert
users and professionals in creating maps more efficiently. We have also
outlined further technical improvements and emphasized the new role of
cartographers to advance the paradigm of AI-assisted map-making.

Motivation: 现有Transformer（基于SDPA）在固定上下文长度的视觉任务中计算/内存开销较大，且训练常依赖复杂技巧（数据增强、位置编码、学习率策略），限制了效率与稳定性。作者寻求一种在短上下文场景中更高效、更稳健、且能达到SOTA的替代架构。

Method: 1) Token mixing：以非注意力的混合机制跨token交互，降低复杂度；2) Sequence-pooling：以序列级聚合替代逐token输出，提升推理效率；3) 卷积tokenizer：用卷积提取局部视觉特征并生成token；整体在固定上下文长度下设计，避免SDPA的二次复杂度与位置编码依赖。

Result: 在CIFAR100上，Top-1由36.50%→46.29%，Top-5由66.33%→76.31%；模型大小为对比基线的60%；当上下文长度<嵌入维度时，推理效率优于SDPA Transformer。

Conclusion: 该架构在固定上下文长度的视觉任务中兼具精度、效率与训练稳定性，且无需常见训练技巧。代码已开源，为SDPA Transformer在短上下文视觉场景提供了有效替代。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a vision model that adopts token mixing,
sequence-pooling, and convolutional tokenizers to achieve state-of-the-art
performance and efficient inference in fixed context-length tasks. In the
CIFAR100 benchmark, our model significantly improves the baseline of the top 1%
and top 5% validation accuracy from 36.50% to 46.29% and 66.33% to 76.31%,
while being more efficient than the Scaled Dot Product Attention (SDPA)
transformers when the context length is less than the embedding dimension and
only 60% the size. In addition, the architecture demonstrates high training
stability and does not rely on techniques such as data augmentation like mixup,
positional embeddings, or learning rate scheduling. We make our code available
on Github.

### [51] [USO: Unified Style and Subject-Driven Generation via Disentangled and Reward Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18966)
*Shaojin Wu,Mengqi Huang,Yufeng Cheng,Wenxu Wu,Jiahe Tian,Yiming Luo,Fei Ding,Qian He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USO 提出一个统一框架，把“风格相似性”和“主题一致性”两目标合并，通过解耦与重组内容与风格来实现，配合大规模三元组数据、双重训练目标与风格奖励学习，并发布联合评测基准，开源代码表现达SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法把风格驱动与主题驱动生成割裂对立：要么像风格、要么保主体，难以兼顾。作者认为本质是内容-风格解耦与重组问题，可以在单一框架下统一，提升两者兼得的可行性与可复现评测。

Method: 1) 构建大规模三元组数据集：内容图、风格图及其对应的“风格化内容图”。2) 设计“解耦式学习”方案：包含风格对齐训练（对齐风格特征）与内容-风格解耦训练（从风格中剥离内容特征）两条互补目标。3) 引入风格奖励学习（SRL）：以奖励信号优化生成过程，进一步强化风格相似性且不损主体。4) 发布联合评测基准 USO-Bench，提供多指标同时评估风格相似与主题一致。

Result: 在公开实验中，USO 在主题一致性与风格相似性两维度均达到开源模型的最优或并列最优表现；在 USO-Bench 多指标上取得领先。

Conclusion: 风格与主题并非对立，可在统一的解耦-重组框架中协同优化。USO 通过三元组数据、双目标训练与奖励学习实现两者兼顾，并提供首个联合基准促进该方向的公平比较与发展。

Abstract: Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven
generation as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity,
whereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent
antagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single
framework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and
re-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven
research. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized
customization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset
consisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized
content images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that
simultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style
through two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and
content-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style
reward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's
performance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly
evaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art
performance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject
consistency and style similarity. Code and model:

TL;DR: N/A

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: N/A

Method: N/A

Result: N/A

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Visual localization (VL) is the task of estimating the camera pose in a known
scene. VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the
scene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of
images or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,
NeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality
novel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising
privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as
sensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this
challenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess
privacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained
with photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry
representations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head
that predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving
Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation
supervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a
self-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable
scene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space
of ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding
state-of-the-art results.

*Eric López,Artemis Llabrés,Ernest Valveny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 用RAG替代“全页拼接/超大VLM”，先检索相关片段再生成答案；文本检索带来最高收益，纯视觉检索在无OCR条件下也有效；真正提升来源于检索与重排，版面分块策略无助。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多页文档VQA内存与效率受限：要么把所有页面拼接，要么依赖超大模型，均代价高。RAG可能以低成本提升效果，但在文档场景中文本/视觉检索各自价值与组件贡献尚不清晰。

Method: 系统评估RAG在文档VQA中的不同检索方案：1) 基于OCR文本的检索；2) 纯视觉检索（无OCR）。在MP-DocVQA、DUDE、InfographicVQA上跨多种模型对比“全页拼接”基线，并进行消融：检索、重排、以及布局引导分块（layout-guided chunking）的作用分析。

Result: 文本中心RAG对比拼接基线最高提升+22.5 ANLS；纯视觉检索在无OCR下也有+5.0 ANLS提升。消融显示主要收益来自检索与重排；多篇文档中常见的布局引导分块并未带来增益。

Conclusion: 在多页文档VQA中，精心的证据选择（检索+重排）稳定提升多种模型与数据集的准确率，且在无OCR时纯视觉检索仍具实用价值；相比之下，布局分块策略不必然有效，RAG是更具性价比的实用方案。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents
that span dozens of pages, yet leading systems still concatenate every page or
rely on very large vision-language models, both of which are memory-hungry.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first
retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from
this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of
incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants -
text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR -
across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets
MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the
"concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant
achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An
ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the
gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent
works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts
accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring
its practical value for real-world Document VQA.

*Shaivi Malik,Hasnat Md Abdullah,Sriparna Saha,Amit Sheth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GRAS基准与GRAS Bias Score，系统评测VLM在性别、种族、年龄、肤色上的偏见；5个SOTA模型偏见显著，最优仅得2/100；VQA偏见评估需多种问题表述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLM已广泛用于现实场景，但其在多样人群属性上的偏见缺乏全面、可解释、可复现实证评估；现有数据与指标覆盖有限，难以比较与改进模型。

Method: 1) 构建GRAS基准：覆盖性别、种族、年龄、肤色等多维人口属性，提供图像与多样化问题模板；2) 设计GRAS Bias Score：可解释的偏见量化指标；3) 以VQA任务对5个SOTA VLM进行系统评测；4) 对同一语义采用多种问题表述，分析表述对偏见测量的影响。

Result: 所有评测模型均表现出显著偏见；偏见最小的模型GRAS Bias Score仅为2/100，显示整体偏见水平令人担忧；多种问题表述显著影响偏见评估结果。

Conclusion: VLM在关键人口学维度存在系统性偏见，需要更全面的测试与改进；GRAS与Bias Score为社区提供标准化评测工具；进行VQA偏见评估时应采用多表述方法；公开代码与数据有助于复现与后续研究。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) become integral to real-world applications,
understanding their demographic biases is critical. We introduce GRAS, a
benchmark for uncovering demographic biases in VLMs across gender, race, age,
and skin tone, offering the most diverse coverage to date. We further propose
the GRAS Bias Score, an interpretable metric for quantifying bias. We benchmark
five state-of-the-art VLMs and reveal concerning bias levels, with the least
biased model attaining a GRAS Bias Score of only 2 out of 100. Our findings
also reveal a methodological insight: evaluating bias in VLMs with visual
question answering (VQA) requires considering multiple formulations of a
question. Our code, data, and evaluation results are publicly available.

TL;DR: N/A


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: N/A

Method: N/A

Result: N/A

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing
three-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from
airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of
current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or
learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering
strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually
designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better
than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based
approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not
truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second
is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,
leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric
characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network
training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,
named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds
in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer
encoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance
masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the
segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module
(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to
enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,
we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the
influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss
to constrain the network training.

### [56] [MicroDetect-Net (MDN): Leveraging Deep Learning to Detect Microplastics in Clam Blood, a Step Towards Human Blood Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19021)
*Riju Marwah,Riya Arora,Navneet Yadav,Himank Arora*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MicroDetect-Net (MDN)：结合尼罗红荧光染色与卷积神经网络，对血样荧光显微图像中微塑料进行分割与计数；在276张图像上取得约92%准确率与优良的IoU/F1/Precision/Recall。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微塑料已在空气、水、土壤与生物体内普遍存在，可能引发肝脏感染、肠道损伤与菌群失衡等健康风险；然而血液样本中微塑料的高通量、客观检测仍具挑战，传统方法费时、依赖人工、敏感度与一致性不足。需要一个自动化、准确的图像分析流程以支撑人体样本检测与流行病学研究。

Method: 构建MDN流程：1) 采用尼罗红（Nile Red）对微塑料进行荧光染色；2) 用荧光显微镜采集血样图像（本研究以蛤蜊血液为近似模型）；3) 基于卷积神经网络进行图像分割，实现微塑料碎片的定位与计数；4) 以准确率、IoU、F1、Precision、Recall评估模型表现。

Result: 在276张尼罗红染色的血液荧光图像上，MDN达到：Accuracy 92.0%、IoU 87.4%、F1 92.1%、Precision 90.6%、Recall 93.7%，显示出稳健的检测与分割性能。

Conclusion: MDN将尼罗红荧光染色与CNN分割有效结合，可在血液样本中自动检测与计数微塑料，性能优良；尽管使用蛤蜊血限制了对人类血液的直接外推，但该方法为向人体样本扩展与建立更一致的基线数据提供了可行路径。

Abstract: With the prevalence of plastics exceeding 368 million tons yearly,
microplastic pollution has grown to an extent where air, water, soil, and
living organisms have all tested positive for microplastic presence. These
particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters in size, are no less harmful to
humans than to the environment. Toxicity research on microplastics has shown
that exposure may cause liver infection, intestinal injuries, and gut flora
imbalance, leading to numerous potential health hazards. This paper presents a
new model, MicroDetect-Net (MDN), which applies fluorescence microscopy with
Nile Red dye staining and deep learning to scan blood samples for
microplastics. Although clam blood has certain limitations in replicating real
human blood, this study opens avenues for applying the approach to human
samples, which are more consistent for preliminary data collection. The MDN
model integrates dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and segmentation
using a convolutional neural network to localize and count microplastic
fragments. The combination of convolutional networks and Nile Red dye for
segmentation produced strong image detection and accuracy. MDN was evaluated on
a dataset of 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images and achieved an
accuracy of ninety two percent. Robust performance was observed with an
Intersection over Union of 87.4 percent, F1 score of 92.1 percent, Precision of
90.6 percent, and Recall of 93.7 percent. These metrics demonstrate the
effectiveness of MDN in the detection of microplastics.

### [57] [ProPy: Building Interactive Prompt Pyramids upon CLIP for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19024)
*Yi Pan,Yujia Zhang,Michael Kampffmeyer,Xiaoguang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ProPy，将CLIP架构系统性改造用于“部分相关视频检索”（PRVR），通过提示金字塔与祖先-后代交互机制建模多粒度事件语义，刷新三数据集SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PRVR需根据只与视频某些片段相关的文本查询进行检索。现有方法多在单模态或专门模型上改进，未充分利用强大的预训练视觉-语言模型（如CLIP）。需要一种方式把CLIP的跨模态对齐能力适配到多粒度、部分相关的事件级检索。

Method: 在CLIP基础上做两点改造：1）Prompt Pyramid（提示金字塔）：构造多层事件提示，分别对应不同语义粒度（如短动作、子事件、长事件），以组织和提炼跨尺度语义；2）Ancestor-Descendant Interaction（祖先-后代交互）：在金字塔层级间建立动态交互，让上层（粗粒度）与下层（细粒度）语义相互引导与一致化，从而更精准地对齐文本查询与视频片段。整体是对视频帧/clip与文本在多粒度上编码、交互、聚合，得到用于PRVR的匹配得分。

Result: 在三个公开PRVR数据集上取得SOTA，相比以往方法有显著优势（文中称显著提升），证明CLIP适配的有效性与通用性。

Conclusion: 通过多粒度提示组织与层级交互，将CLIP成功迁移到PRVR场景，显著提升对只与部分片段相关的查询的检索性能；方法通用且可作为基于VLM的PRVR新范式。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task
that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific
segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to
process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP
remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a
model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for
PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events,
ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that
organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels,
and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that
enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy
achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous
models by significant margins. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 用8,449个3D血管几何模型进行自监督预训练（以热核签名为目标）学习形状表征，再迁移到仅49例临床冠状动脉数据上，以提升基于机器学习的壁面切应力（WSS）分区（低/中/高）任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WSS等血流动力学生物标志物对于心血管疾病有价值，但基于CFD计算代价高、训练机器学习模型又受数据稀缺所限。作者希望通过大规模几何模型上的自监督预训练与基础模型策略，缓解小样本临床数据下WSS评估不稳的问题。

Method: - 收集8,449个3D血管几何模型，构建自监督学习任务。
- 以拉普拉斯特征分解得到的热核签名（HKS）作为自监督目标，促使网络学习捕捉形状本质的几何表征。
- 将学到的几何表示迁移到冠脉WSS分区任务：在49例临床冠状动脉数据上对时间平均WSS进行低/中/高分割（分类/分区）。

Result: 预训练得到的几何表示在小样本临床数据上显著提升了冠脉WSS分区（低/中/高）的分割性能，相比无预训练或基线方法更优。

Conclusion: 利用HKS驱动的自监督几何预训练可有效缓解临床数据稀缺，提升冠脉WSS评估与分区效果；表明大规模血管几何库可以作为基础模型预训练资源，促进心血管影像中的血流动力学生物标志物评估。

Abstract: Leveraging big data for patient care is promising in many medical fields such
as cardiovascular health. For example, hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear
stress could be assessed from patient-specific medical images via machine
learning algorithms, bypassing the need for time-intensive computational fluid
simulation. However, it is extremely challenging to amass large-enough datasets
to effectively train such models. We could address this data scarcity by means
of self-supervised pre-training and foundations models given large datasets of
geometric artery models. In the context of coronary arteries, leveraging
learned representations to improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment has not yet
been well studied. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a
large dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels
can benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a
small-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target
for the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity
obtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the
shapes. We show how geometric representations learned from this datasets can
boost segmentation of coronary arteries into regions of low, mid and high
(time-averaged) wall shear stress even when trained on limited data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SuperSimpleNet：统一无监督、弱监督、混合监督与全监督四种场景的表面缺陷检测模型，兼顾高精度与<10ms推理速度，在四个基准上刷新表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业表面缺陷检测需要高性能、低延迟且能适配多种标注类型的模型；现有方法常局限于单一监督范式，难以在真实制造场景中利用多样化标注（无/弱/混合/全监督）。

Method: 在SimpleNet基础上构建高效判别式框架，包含：1）新型合成异常生成流程，增强数据与鲁棒性；2）改进分类头，提高判别力与定位能力；3）改良训练过程，使同一模型可在四种监督场景下高效训练并充分利用多源标注。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的基准数据集上，各监督场景均达最优或SOTA性能；推理时间<10ms，兼具准确性与速度。

Conclusion: SuperSimpleNet首次统一并有效利用多监督范式，在保持工业级速度与可靠性的前提下显著提升表面缺陷检测的实用性，缩小学术方法与工业部署的鸿沟；代码可复现（GitHub提供）。

Abstract: Surface defect detection is a critical task across numerous industries, aimed
at efficiently identifying and localising imperfections or irregularities on
manufactured components. While numerous methods have been proposed, many fail
to meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability.
Existing approaches are often constrained to specific supervision scenarios and
struggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world
manufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed
supervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we
propose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model
built on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel
synthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an
improved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four
supervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging
all available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets a new standard for
performance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four
challenging benchmark datasets. Beyond accuracy, it is very fast, achieving an
inference time below 10 ms. With its ability to unify diverse supervision
paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet
represents a promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing
challenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial
applications. Code: https://github.com/blaz-r/SuperSimpleNet

*Serban C. Tudosie,Alexander Denker,Zeljko Kereta,Simon Arridge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种用于单像素成像的双层优化方法，直接学习任务相关的二值照明模式，结合STE与总深度变分正则，在显著欠采样下重建质量优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单像素成像需要通过序列化结构光图案来采样场景，但通用或随机图案（如Hadamard/随机二进制）在特定任务（如荧光显微）和强欠采样时重建质量有限。希望端到端地为特定数据分布与重建网络共同优化最优的二值照明模式，以提升效率与成像质量。

Method: 构建双层优化：下层为给定二值照明模式下的重建网络（或重建过程）训练，上层优化照明模式本身以最小化重建损失。为解决二值不可导问题，采用Straight-Through Estimator在反向传播中近似梯度；同时在双层框架中对模式施加Total Deep Variation(TDV)正则，鼓励结构化、可实现的图案。以CytoImageNet显微数据进行端到端学习，目标为特定任务的高保真重建，尤其在低采样率。

Result: 相较于基线（如随机/Hadamard模式或未针对任务优化的图案），所学得的二值照明模式在CytoImageNet上显著提升重建PSNR/SSIM等指标；在高度欠采样（极少投影/图案数）条件下优势更明显。

Conclusion: 通过STE与TDV正则的双层优化，可有效学习任务特定的二值照明模式，显著提升单像素荧光显微的重建性能，特别适合资源受限或快速成像场景。

Abstract: Single-Pixel Imaging enables reconstructing objects using a single detector
through sequential illuminations with structured light patterns. We propose a
bilevel optimisation method for learning task-specific, binary illumination
patterns, optimised for applications like single-pixel fluorescence microscopy.
We address the non-differentiable nature of binary pattern optimisation using
the Straight-Through Estimator and leveraging a Total Deep Variation
regulariser in the bilevel formulation. We demonstrate our method on the
CytoImageNet microscopy dataset and show that learned patterns achieve superior
reconstruction performance compared to baseline methods, especially in highly
undersampled regimes.

Result: N/A

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Event cameras are a bio-inspired class of sensors that asynchronously measure
per-pixel intensity changes. Under fixed illumination conditions in static or
low-motion scenes, rigidly mounted event cameras are unable to generate any
events, becoming unsuitable for most computer vision tasks. To address this
limitation, recent work has investigated motion-induced event stimulation that
often requires complex hardware or additional optical components. In contrast,
we introduce a lightweight approach to sustain persistent event generation by
employing a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational
motion. This is combined with a motion-compensation pipeline that removes the
injected motion and yields clean, motion-corrected events for downstream
perception tasks. We demonstrate our approach with a hardware prototype and
evaluate it on real-world captured datasets. Our method reliably recovers
motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection
over event-based sensing without motion induction.

*Rafael Sterzinger,Tingyu Lin,Robert Sablatnig*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 用极少标注（每手稿仅3页），用轻量UNet++配合拓扑/连通性感知损失做历史文档文本行分割，显著超越SOTA（RA+200%、LIoU+75%，F-measure达或超竞赛冠军），证明小模型+拓扑损失在小数据场景更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文档文本行分割依赖大量高质量标注，但获取成本高且需专家，导致深度学习难以泛化；因此需要在少样本条件下仍能稳定避免常见的拓扑错误（断线、粘连），以提升实用性与标注效率。

Method: - 架构：采用轻量级UNet++（小而简单的编码器-解码器）。
- 损失：引入连接性/拓扑感知损失（源自神经元形态重建），对结构性错误（行断裂、错误合并）施加强惩罚。
- 数据策略：每份手稿仅标注3页，从中抽取小patch做训练，实现样本扩增与数据高效利用。
- 任务：文本行分割，评估于U-DIADS-TL与DIVA-HisDB相关基线任务。

Result: 在U-DIADS-TL上：Recognition Accuracy提升约200%，Line IoU提升约75%；在DIVA-HisDB基线检测任务上，F-Measure达到或超过竞赛冠军水平；在仅用极少标注的条件下，性能优于更复杂模型。

Conclusion: 小而简的UNet++结合拓扑感知损失，在少样本历史文档场景可强力缓解结构性分割错误，具更高数据效率与准确度，能以极低标注成本达到或超过现有SOTA；代码已开源，具复现实用价值。

Abstract: A foundational task for the digital analysis of documents is text line
segmentation. However, automating this process with deep learning models is
challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often
unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a
labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes
few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this
work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a
topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more
complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware
loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes
structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To
increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere
three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves
upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200%
increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over
Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even
exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection
task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy
of our approach. Our implementation is publicly available at:

*Yuzhen Li,Min Liu,Yuan Bian,Xueping Wang,Zhaoyang Li,Gen Li,Yaonan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出针对单目3D视觉指代任务的文本-几何增强方法，缓解语言模型对数值单位不敏感的问题，通过文本预处理(单位多样化映射)与文本引导的几何增强模块，显著提升Mono3DRefer上的性能，尤其“Far”场景提升11.94%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练语言模型在包含几何量的描述中，对数值大小敏感但忽略计量单位，导致等值单位换算（米→分米/厘米）会触发严重性能下降，暴露了模型3D理解薄弱、文本特征误导几何感知的问题。需要增强文本对物理尺度与单位的一致理解，并让几何特征受益于更可靠的文本几何线索。

Method: 1) 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE)：在文本预处理阶段，通过扩增距离/长度等描述的单位与表达形式，建立不同单位之间的显式映射与多样化表述，提升模型对单位换算与等值关系的鲁棒性。2) Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE)：将基础文本特征投射到几何一致的子空间，得到“3D增强”文本特征；再用其精确引导几何特征的注意力分配，从而强化文本-几何对齐与3D感知。整体在单目RGB输入下执行3D视觉指代。

Result: 在Mono3DRefer上进行大量对比与消融，整体超过现有方法，尤其在“Far”场景准确率提升11.94%，显示出在远距离/尺度敏感场景中的明显优势。

Conclusion: 通过文本单位多样化预处理与文本引导的几何一致性投射，缓解语言模型对单位不敏感的问题，提升文本-几何对齐与3D理解，取得新的SOTA表现；代码将开源。

Abstract: Monocular 3D visual grounding is a novel task that aims to locate 3D objects
in RGB images using text descriptions with explicit geometry information.
Despite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the text
embeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largely
ignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistant
mapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads to
severe performance degradation, even though the physical length remains
equivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trained
language model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3D
perception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on text
embeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods.
Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE),
which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between different
units by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries.
Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to further
enhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features into
geometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are then
leveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluate
the proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on the
Mono3DRefer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements
over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with a notable
accuracy gain of 11.94\% in the "Far" scenario. Our code will be made publicly
available.

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision
tasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings
fundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images
through patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches
lack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence
between Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby
limiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively.
We propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a
mathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional
coordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly
periodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational
invariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the
non-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance
relationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct
derivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs
from their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
WEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including
63.78\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture,
93.28\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on
VTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms the distance-decay
property through rigorous mathematical proof, while attention visualization
reveals enhanced geometric inductive bias and more coherent semantic focus
compared to conventional approaches.The source code implementing the methods
described in this paper is publicly available on GitHub.

Motivation: N/A

Method: N/A

Result: N/A

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into
sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens
sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably
reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each
vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long
token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose
an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and
faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an
autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count
to approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.
Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single
step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency
matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,
we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural
arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge
connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than
8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.

*Weixin Ye,Hongguang Zhu,Wei Wang,Yahui Liu,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出“All-in-One Slider”模块，在单一轻量模型中实现对T2I扩散模型多种语义属性的可解释、连续可调操控，并支持零样本与属性组合，优于以往“一属性一滑杆”的做法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通过“滑杆”操控扩散模型属性的方法需为每个属性单独训练，导致参数冗余、扩展性差、难以在细粒度和复杂人脸等高细节场景下稳定控制。需要一种统一、可扩展且可解释的多属性控制机制。

Method: 提出All-in-One Slider：在文本嵌入空间中学习稀疏、语义可解释的属性方向分解。训练后，一个模块即可作为通用滑杆对多种属性进行连续调节；通过重组合成新的方向实现未见属性（如种族、名人）零样本操控与多属性组合。可与inversion流程结合，将真实图像映射到扩散模型潜空间后进行同样的属性操控。

Result: 在多项实验中，相比以往为每个属性单独训练的滑杆方法，该方法在属性操控的准确性、可扩展性与可解释性上显著提升；展示了对未见属性与属性组合的有效控制。

Conclusion: All-in-One Slider以轻量统一模块实现多属性、细粒度、可解释的文本引导图像操控，并支持零样本与真实图像编辑，具有更好的实用性与扩展性；代码与模型将开源。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant strides in
generating high-quality images. However, progressively manipulating certain
attributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains
challenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.
Some studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.
However, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is
trained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new
attribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy
accumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical
applications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this
issue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes
the text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute
directions. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling
interpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.
Moreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports
zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and
the composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving
notable improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our method can
be extended to integrate with the inversion framework to perform attribute
manipulation on real images, broadening its applicability to various real-world
scenarios. The code and trained model will be released at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种直接生成大规模3D驾驶场景的方法，兼具几何准确性与可控性，实现因果一致的新视角合成与显式3D几何估计，弥合神经重建（几何真但不可控）与扩散生成（可控但缺乏几何与因果）之间的鸿沟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大规模场景数据对机器人/自动驾驶学习至关重要。神经重建可从传感器数据还原室外场景，但环境静态、受采集轨迹限制、可控性差；扩散模型可控却缺乏几何扎实与因果一致性。需要一种既可控又几何精确的3D场景生成方案。

Method: 生成“代理几何+环境表示”，并结合从2D图像先验（如扩散模型）进行得分蒸馏（score distillation）。通过提示词与地图布局条件，引导几何与纹理结构生成，实现可控的3D驾驶场景构建与渲染。

Result: 方法能产生真实感强、几何一致的复杂驾驶3D场景；支持对象持久性、因果一致的新视角合成，并在提示与地图条件下实现高可控的几何与高保真纹理。

Conclusion: 所提方法在可控性与几何扎实性之间取得平衡，为大规模3D驾驶数据的生成提供新途径，克服神经重建与纯2D生成各自的局限，适用于训练与测试自动驾驶/机器人系统。

Abstract: Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot
learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of
reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor
data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow
for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and
trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In
contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models
offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In
this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly
generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for
causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry
estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and
environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image
priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling
the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be
conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent
3D generations of complex driving scenes.

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they
struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's
authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like
audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or
context. To bridge this gap, \textbf{we propose a framework designed to
generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also
semantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is
built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large
Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions
that provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion
generator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production
of actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure
the effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality
conflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel
Pseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to
accurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby
generating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and
linguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
leading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync
accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with
textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to
complex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects.

*Kaveh Safavigerdini,Ramakrishna Surya,Jaired Collins,Prasad Calyam,Filiz Bunyak,Matthew R. Maschmann,Kannappan Palaniappan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VFTrack：一种在SEM序列中自动检测并实时跟踪单根（单个）碳纳米管颗粒/特征的框架，实现连续轨迹分解与运动学分析；通过系统评测选出ALIKED+LightGlue为最佳组合，并用运动分解重建生长形貌、估计区域生长速率，从而支持CNT合成的实时优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNT生长的动力学对纳米制造至关重要，但SEM下的纳米尺度运动测量很难：ex situ只给静态图，in situ方法常需人工初始化、不能持续逐粒子轨迹分解。因此需要一个自动、实时、鲁棒的视觉跟踪方法来量化CNT生长与形貌演化。

Method: 提出VFTrack框架：在SEM视频中采用可插拔的特征检测器+匹配器（可选手工或深度）进行关键点检测与对应，嵌入粒子/特征跟踪框架以生成连续轨迹；使用大规模（13,540）人工标注轨迹进行系统评测，比对不同检测-匹配组合，选出性能最优；将得到的运动向量分解为轴向生长、侧向漂移与振荡分量，进一步进行区域生长率估计与微柱形貌重建。

Result: 最佳组合为ALIKED检测器+LightGlue匹配器，F1=0.78，α-score=0.89；VFTrack可在in situ、实时条件下自动产生每粒子连续轨迹，支持对CNT微柱生长的运动学分解、空间异质生长率计算和形貌随时间的重建。

Conclusion: VFTrack实现了从SEM视频到可用动力学量化的自动化链路，填补了实验观测与物理模型之间的空白，为CNT合成的实时监控与优化提供工具；方法通用、可扩展至其他纳米材料的自动表征。

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are critical building blocks in nanotechnology, yet
the characterization of their dynamic growth is limited by the experimental
challenges in nanoscale motion measurement using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) imaging. Existing ex situ methods offer only static analysis, while in
situ techniques often require manual initialization and lack continuous
per-particle trajectory decomposition. We present Visual Feature Tracking
(VFTrack) an in-situ real-time particle tracking framework that automatically
detects and tracks individual CNT particles in SEM image sequences. VFTrack
integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle
tracking framework to enable kinematic analysis of CNT micropillar growth. A
systematic using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories identifies the ALIKED
detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination (F1-score of 0.78,
$\alpha$-score of 0.89). VFTrack motion vectors decomposed into axial growth,
lateral drift, and oscillations, facilitate the calculation of heterogeneous
regional growth rates and the reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar
morphologies. This work enables advancement in automated nano-material
characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and
experimental observation to enable real-time optimization of CNT synthesis.

TL;DR: AUSM把视频分割统一成“逐帧自回归的掩码预测”问题，在同一架构下同时支持有提示与无提示的流式视频分割，训练更快、基准更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用常需要无提示地检测并跟踪视频中所有目标，但当前生态被不同任务/模型割裂；同时现有强模型（如SAM2）更偏向有提示分割，难以统一且训练/推理在长视频上效率受限。

Method: 将流式视频分割重构为类似语言建模的“顺序掩码预测”任务；提出AUSM：基于状态空间模型(SSM)保持固定大小的空间状态以处理任意长视频；架构各组件可在帧间并行训练，实现相较迭代式训练的显著加速；同一模型同时支持有提示与无提示设定。

Result: 在DAVIS17、YouTube-VOS 2018/2019、MOSE、YouTube-VIS 2019/2021、OVIS等基准上，优于以往通用流式视频分割方法；在16帧序列上实现最高约2.5倍的训练加速。

Conclusion: AUSM以自回归掩码建模统一并简化视频分割任务，在长序列可扩展性、训练并行化与跨设定性能上带来实质提升，兼顾精度与效率。

Abstract: Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video
segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many
real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and
track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape
fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video
segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and
introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single
architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation.
Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state
and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of
AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial
speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS
2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior
universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster
training on 16-frame sequences.

Abstract: We introduce Style4D-Bench, the first benchmark suite specifically designed
for 4D stylization, with the goal of standardizing evaluation and facilitating
progress in this emerging area. Style4D-Bench comprises: 1) a comprehensive
evaluation protocol measuring spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and
multi-view consistency through both perceptual and quantitative metrics, 2) a
strong baseline that make an initial attempt for 4D stylization, and 3) a
curated collection of high-resolution dynamic 4D scenes with diverse motions
and complex backgrounds. To establish a strong baseline, we present Style4D, a
novel framework built upon 4D Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three key
components: a basic 4DGS scene representation to capture reliable geometry, a
Style Gaussian Representation that leverages lightweight per-Gaussian MLPs for
temporally and spatially aware appearance control, and a Holistic
Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module designed to enhance spatio-temporal
consistency via contrastive coherence learning and structural content
preservation. Extensive experiments on Style4D-Bench demonstrate that Style4D
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D stylization, producing fine-grained
stylistic details with stable temporal dynamics and consistent multi-view
rendering. We expect Style4D-Bench to become a valuable resource for
benchmarking and advancing research in stylized rendering of dynamic 3D scenes.

*Oishi Deb,Anjun Hu,Ashkan Khakzar,Philip Torr,Christian Rupprecht*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Articulate3D 是一个无需再训练的语言驱动3D姿态编辑方法：先用改造的图像生成模型产出目标视图，再通过多视角+关键点对齐优化网格姿态，能在保持物体身份/结构下实现自由文本指令的姿态操控，实验与用户研究显示显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉与多模态模型进步显著，想要用自然语言直接控制现有3D资产的姿态仍困难：要既改变姿态又保持原始几何/外观一致性，且渲染梯度常不稳定，现有方法易形变崩坏或需繁琐训练。

Method: 两阶段：1) 条件图像生成：对强大的文本图像生成器进行自注意力重接线（RSActrl），将“结构”与“姿态”解耦，给定输入网格渲染与文本指令生成目标视图，保证身份一致、姿态变化。2) 网格对齐：多视角姿态优化，不依赖易噪声的可微渲染像素损失，而是通过关键点在输入与目标图像间建立对应，驱动网格关节/形变参数优化。全流程无需额外训练。

Result: 在多类3D对象与自由文本指令下成功编辑姿态，能保持网格身份与细节；定量指标和用户研究（>85%偏好）均优于现有方法；展示更稳健的多视角一致性与更少的结构漂移。

Conclusion: 将生成模型的结构-姿态解耦与关键点驱动的多视角优化结合，可实现训练自由、稳健的语言控制3D姿态编辑，优于依赖可微渲染像素监督或需再训练的方法。

Abstract: We propose a training-free method, Articulate3D, to pose a 3D asset through
language control. Despite advances in vision and language models, this task
remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the
problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target
images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the
mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In
detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that
decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model,
allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We
observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation
optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between
input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated
across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully
manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh.
Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was
preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing
approaches. Project page:https://odeb1.github.io/articulate3d_page_deb/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VoxHammer 是一个无需训练的3D潜空间本地编辑方法，通过在扩散逆过程与去噪阶段对“保留区域”的特征进行替换与缓存，显著提升未编辑区域的一致性与整体连贯性；并发布了带精确区域标注的Edit3D-Bench进行评测，实验优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视角图像编辑再重建的流程难以严格保真未编辑区域，导致3D一致性差、接缝与漂移问题；需要一种直接在3D结构化生成模型的潜空间中进行区域级控制的方案，并缺乏专门评测未编辑区域一致性的基准。

Method: 1) 以结构化3D生成模型为基础，对输入3D模型进行“逆向轨迹”预测，得到每个时间步的反演潜变量与注意力KV缓存；2) 在去噪/编辑阶段，对标注的“保留区域”将去噪特征替换为对应的反演潜变量和缓存的KV Token，保持其上下文不变；3) 对编辑区域正常引导编辑，从而在保持保留区重建一致性的同时，实现编辑区与整体的连贯融合；4) 构建人标注的Edit3D-Bench，精确提供3D编辑掩膜以量化评测。

Result: 在Edit3D-Bench及多种场景上，VoxHammer在未编辑区域的3D一致性与总体图像/几何质量上显著优于现有方法；能稳定重建保留部分并无缝融合编辑部分，支持高质量成对数据合成。

Conclusion: 通过在3D潜空间中缓存并回放保留区域的上下文特征，VoxHammer实现了精确、本地且连贯的3D编辑；该方法训练成本低、泛化性强，并为后续基于上下文的3D生成提供高质量数据基础与评测标准。

Abstract: 3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot
interaction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then
reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving
unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative
models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs
precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer
first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and
key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing
phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the
corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these
contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of
preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the
consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a
human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully
labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of
preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for
synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data
foundation for in-context 3D generation. See our project page at

Abstract: Deep understanding of electromagnetic signals is fundamental to dynamic
spectrum management, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and
unmanned vehicle perception. The field faces challenges because electromagnetic
signals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong
background noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents
existing general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and
sensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and
transfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the
creation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these
issue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that
bridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We
build the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset
covering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties
of electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing
method and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and
representation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals. Experiments
show that EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across
many downstream tasks, moving decisively from task specific models to a unified
framework for electromagnetic intelligence. The code is available at:

Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of
disability worldwide. Clinical guidelines establish diffusion resonance imaging
(DWI, ADC) as the standard for localizing, characterizing, and measuring
infarct volume, enabling treatment support and prognosis. Nonetheless, such
lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics,
scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Computational support approaches have
been key to helping with the localization and segmentation of lesions. However,
these strategies are dedicated solutions that learn patterns from only one
institution, lacking the variability to generalize geometrical lesions shape
models. Even worse, many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled samples to
adjust these dedicated solutions. This work developed a collaborative framework
for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in DWI sequences by sharing knowledge
from deep center-independent representations. From 14 emulated healthcare
centers with 2031 studies, the FedAvg model achieved a general DSC of $0.71 \pm
0.24$, AVD of $5.29 \pm 22.74$, ALD of $2.16 \pm 3.60$ and LF1 of $0.70 \pm
0.26$ over all centers, outperforming both the centralized and other federated
rules. Interestingly, the model demonstrated strong generalization properties,
showing uniform performance across different lesion categories and reliable
performance in out-of-distribution centers (with DSC of $0.64 \pm 0.29$ and AVD
of $4.44 \pm 8.74$ without any additional training).

TL;DR: 在三类MedMNIST子集上评估SalUn机器遗忘：在不牺牲鲁棒性的前提下，接近完全重训的效果；数据增广会影响遗忘质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗影像分类常涉及隐私与合规需求，一旦需要删除敏感数据，传统做法是从头重训，代价高昂。机器遗忘可在不完全重训的情况下移除特定数据，但在医疗影像场景尚缺系统性评估。

Method: 选用SalUn作为遗忘方法，在PathMNIST、OrganAMNIST、BloodMNIST上对含敏感样本的预训练模型进行遗忘实验；对比基线为从头重训（gold standard）与可能的保留/朴素微调策略；同时考察数据增广策略对遗忘质量与保留性能的影响。主要评价指标为分类性能（如准确率/AUROC）与遗忘有效性（如被遗忘样本的成员推断攻击成功率或性能下降）。

Result: SalUn在三个数据集上的保留任务性能接近完全重训基线，显著优于不做遗忘或简单微调；数据增广会改变遗忘-保留的权衡，适当增广可提升保留集鲁棒性，但可能削弱对被遗忘数据的彻底性（或相反，具体取决于增广策略）。总体显示SalUn在医学影像上具有效率与有效性。

Conclusion: SalUn为医疗影像分类提供了高效可行的机器遗忘方案，能在较低计算成本下达到接近重训的性能；数据增广需谨慎设计以兼顾遗忘彻底性与保留性能，建议作为实际部署时的关键调参维度。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove private or sensitive data from a
pre-trained model while preserving the model's robustness. Despite recent
advances, this technique has not been explored in medical image classification.
This work evaluates the SalUn unlearning model by conducting experiments on the
PathMNIST, OrganAMNIST, and BloodMNIST datasets. We also analyse the impact of
data augmentation on the quality of unlearning. Results show that SalUn
achieves performance close to full retraining, indicating an efficient solution
for use in medical applications.

Abstract: In this paper a comparative study of the performance of three Convolutional
Neural Network models, ResNet50, Inception v3 and VGG19 for classification of
skin images with lesions affected by psoriasis is presented. The images used
for training and validation of the models were obtained from specialized
platforms. Some techniques were used to adjust the evaluation metrics of the
neural networks. The results found suggest the model Inception v3 as a valuable
tool for supporting the diagnosis of psoriasis. This is due to its satisfactory
performance with respect to accuracy and F1-Score (97.5% ${\pm}$ 0.2).

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence models for macular edema (ME)
analy-sis always relies on expert-annotated pixel-level image datasets which
are expen-sive to collect prospectively. While anomaly-detection-based
weakly-supervised methods have shown promise in edema area (EA) segmentation
task, their per-formance still lags behind fully-supervised approaches. In this
paper, we leverage the strong correlation between EA and retinal layers in
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images, along with the
update characteristics of weakly-supervised learning, to enhance an
off-the-shelf adversarial framework for EA segmentation with a novel
layer-structure-guided post-processing step and a test-time-adaptation (TTA)
strategy. By incorporating additional retinal lay-er information, our framework
reframes the dense EA prediction task as one of confirming intersection points
between the EA contour and retinal layers, result-ing in predictions that
better align with the shape prior of EA. Besides, the TTA framework further
helps address discrepancies in the manifestations and presen-tations of EA
between training and test sets. Extensive experiments on two pub-licly
available datasets demonstrate that these two proposed ingredients can im-prove
the accuracy and robustness of EA segmentation, bridging the gap between
weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.

Abstract: MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool allowing to non-invasively visualize
patient anatomy and pathology with high soft-tissue contrast. However, MRI
acquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and
increased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial
research effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI
acquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the
fully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly
reconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary
goal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing
interest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated
MRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed
in isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or
private datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no
high-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal
strategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper
provides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI
data comparing 7 approaches. A particular focus is placed on comparing
\textit{one-stage approaches}, that combine reconstruction and segmentation
into a unified model, with \textit{two-stage approaches}, that utilize
established MRI reconstruction methods followed by a segmentation network. We
test these methods on two MRI datasets that include multi-coil k-space data as
well as a human-annotated segmentation ground-truth. We find that simple
two-stage methods that consider data-consistency lead to the best segmentation
scores, surpassing complex specialized methods that are developed specifically
for this task.

TL;DR: 提出RDDM：直接在RAW域做扩散复原，结合RAW域VAE、可微后调色模块、合成RAW退化数据与多拜耳LoRA，较sRGB域方法更高保真、伪影更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: sRGB域扩散复原受限于输入有损与ISP管线信息丢失，且在真实感与高保真间权衡；许多场景可直接获取传感器RAW，但现有方法忽略。直接在RAW域处理可避免信息丢失并更贴近成像物理。

Method: 1) 设计RAW域VAE（RVAE）学习适配RAW的潜空间；2) 引入可微的后色调处理（PTP）模块，将RAW→sRGB映射纳入端到端优化，实现RAW与sRGB联合目标；3) 构建可扩展退化管线，从现有sRGB数据合成RAW低/高质量成对样本以支撑大规模训练；4) 提出可配置多拜耳（CMB）LoRA，适配不同拜耳排列（RGGB、BGGR等）缓解分布外(OOD)；5) 以扩散模型为主干，实现端到端RAW输入→高质输出。

Result: 在多基准上优于最先进sRGB域扩散方法，生成更高保真、伪影更少的图像；对不同拜耳模式有良好泛化；在数据不足条件下仍保持稳健。

Conclusion: 在RAW域进行扩散复原并配合RVAE、PTP、合成退化数据与CMB LoRA，可绕开传统ISP+IR两阶段瓶颈，缓解OOD问题，取得更真实高保真的重建效果，显示端到端RAW工作流的可行性与优势。

Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion
model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data.
While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are
caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these
models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor
RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge
devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by
directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional
two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple
adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the
out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE
(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone
Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To
compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation
pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for
large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)
LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion
methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.
