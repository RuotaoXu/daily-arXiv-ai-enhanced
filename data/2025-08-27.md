### [1] [Towards Training-Free Underwater 3D Object Detection from Sonar Point Clouds: A Comparison of Traditional and Deep Learning Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18293)
*M. Salman Shaukat,Yannik Käckenmeister,Sebastian Bader,Thomas Kirste*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出在无真实数据训练条件下进行水下3D目标检测的两条路线：合成数据训练的深度网络 vs. 无训练的模型/模板匹配；结果显示模板匹配在真实数据上更稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下声呐点云数据昂贵稀缺，采集与标注难度高，导致深度学习难以直接应用。作者想回答：没有真实标注数据能否实现可靠的水下3D检测？

Method: 双路径方法：1）物理逼真的多波束声呐仿真生成大规模合成点云，用于训练现有SOTA 3D检测网络；2）基于几何先验的模板匹配系统，无需训练，直接在点云中匹配人工结构（如规则几何体）的形状与尺度。建立真实波罗的海测深数据集作评测基准。

Result: 在仿真场景上，合成训练的网络达98% mAP；但在真实声呐数据上因域偏移跌至40% mAP。模板匹配在真实数据上达83% mAP，且无需训练，对声学噪声与环境变化更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 深度学习在数据稀缺且域差异明显的水下场景易失效；基于物理与几何先验的训练免费方法在真实任务中更可靠。工作提供首个面向训练免费的水下3D检测大规模基准，并对AUV导航、海洋考古与海上设施监测具有直接启示。

Abstract: Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers
in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh
acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has
revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a
critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively
expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert
surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental
question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without
real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing
two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam
echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar
simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art
neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that
leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry
surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks
trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated
scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.
Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data
without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic
noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom
about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first
large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work
opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine
archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments
where traditional machine learning approaches fail.

### [2] [MobileDenseAttn:A Dual-Stream Architecture for Accurate and Interpretable Brain Tumor Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18294)
*Shudipta Banik,Muna Das,Trapa Banik,Md. Ehsanul Haque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MobileDenseAttn：将MobileNetV2与DenseNet201双流特征级融合，并结合Grad-CAM，在脑MRI四分类任务上取得98.35%测试准确率与稳定F1=0.9835，训练更快、可解释性更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑肿瘤MRI自动检测方法在异质性肿瘤上的泛化有限、计算开销大、解释性与透明度不足，难以建立临床信任；人工判读又耗时且易错，因此需要兼顾高性能、效率与可解释性的模型。

Method: 构建双分支融合网络MobileDenseAttn：并行使用MobileNetV2与DenseNet201提取多尺度特征，在特征层进行融合，并利用Grad-CAM生成可视化热力图；在包含四类（胶质瘤、脑膜瘤、垂体瘤、正常）的6,020张MRI的增强数据集上，采用严格的五折交叉验证训练与评估；与VGG19、DenseNet201、MobileNetV2作基线对比；报告性能与训练时间。

Result: 在五折交叉验证下训练准确率99.75%、测试准确率98.35%、F1=0.9835（95%CI:0.9743–0.9920）；相较VGG19准确率提升+3.67%，训练时间降低39.3%；Grad-CAM可定位肿瘤相关区域，提供直观解释。

Conclusion: MobileDenseAttn在脑MRI四分类上实现高准确、高效率与较强可解释性，较主流基线有显著提升；模型稳定，具备走向临床应用的潜力，能够提供具有临床意义的病灶定位与更高的可信度。

Abstract: The detection of brain tumor in MRI is an important aspect of ensuring timely
diagnostics and treatment; however, manual analysis is commonly long and
error-prone. Current approaches are not universal because they have limited
generalization to heterogeneous tumors, are computationally inefficient, are
not interpretable, and lack transparency, thus limiting trustworthiness. To
overcome these issues, we introduce MobileDenseAttn, a fusion model of dual
streams of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 that can help gradually improve the
feature representation scale, computing efficiency, and visual explanations via
GradCAM. Our model uses feature level fusion and is trained on an augmented
dataset of 6,020 MRI scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors,
and normal samples. Measured under strict 5-fold cross-validation protocols,
MobileDenseAttn provides a training accuracy of 99.75%, a testing accuracy of
98.35%, and a stable F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). The
extensive validation shows the stability of the model, and the comparative
analysis proves that it is a great advancement over the baseline models (VGG19,
DenseNet201, MobileNetV2) with a +3.67% accuracy increase and a 39.3% decrease
in training time compared to VGG19. The GradCAM heatmaps clearly show
tumor-affected areas, offering clinically significant localization and
improving interpretability. These findings position MobileDenseAttn as an
efficient, high performance, interpretable model with a high probability of
becoming a clinically practical tool in identifying brain tumors in the real
world.

### [3] [Can VLMs Recall Factual Associations From Visual References?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18297)
*Dhananjay Ashok,Ashutosh Chaubey,Hirona J. Arai,Jonathan May,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文发现并量化了VLM在“视觉引用→知识回忆”环节的系统性缺陷，并用可解释的内部状态探针准确预测失效，从而在选择性预测场景下提高覆盖率并降低风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM在纯文本提示下能回忆事实，但现实应用常以图像为入口；若模型无法把图像中的实体与其内部知识库对齐，就会在多模态理解任务上产生不可靠回答。作者想验证是否存在这一系统性缺口、其可检测性，以及是否能在不改动模型的前提下缓解应用风险。

Method: 1) 设计受控实验：对比同一实体在文本指代 vs. 视觉指代条件下的事实回忆表现，量化“视觉→知识”链接能力。2) 内部状态分析：识别与失败相关的内部表示模式。3) 训练轻量探针（无需对VLM再训练）：基于内部状态预测当前回答是否不可靠。4) 在VQA选择性预测框架中应用探针，权衡覆盖率与风险。

Result: - 将实体引用限定为图像时，VLM的事实回忆能力约减半。- 探针对“何时不可靠”的识别准确率>92%。- 在VQA选择性预测中，探针使覆盖率提升7.87%（绝对值），同时将错误风险降低0.9%（绝对值）。

Conclusion: VLM存在可系统检测的“视觉到知识”对齐缺陷。内部状态探针可作为实用的失效预警器，在不重训模型下提升应用安全性与有效覆盖。作者建议未来从更强的跨模态实体对齐、训练目标与数据强调视觉指代、以及在推理时动态不确定性估计与校准等方向改进语言落地能力。

Abstract: Through a controlled study, we identify a systematic deficiency in the
multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs). While VLMs can recall
factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their
ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual
instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves
their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to
link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We
show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct
patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states
achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is
unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a
VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of
multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual
question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while
also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic,
detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we
provide informed recommendations for future directions.

### [4] [SERES: Semantic-aware neural reconstruction from sparse views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18314)
*Bo Xu,Yuhu Guo,Yuchao Wang,Wenting Wang,Yeung Yam,Charlie C. L. Wang,Xinyi Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种语义感知的神经重建方法，在稀疏视角下利用补充的语义logits与几何先验，显著降低辐射与形状歧义，DTU上对多种基线大幅降误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏图像重建存在严重的辐射（外观）与形状歧义：匹配误差放大、NeRF/NeuS类方法易陷入错误外观或几何。现有方法多依赖密集视角或强几何先验，鲁棒性不足。作者希望在稀疏输入下稳健建立高保真3D。

Method: 在神经隐式表示（SDF+Radiance）中引入补充的补丁级（patch-based）语义logits分支，作为可优化的语义场，与SDF和辐射场联合训练；同时利用几何原语（primitive）掩码设计正则化，约束形状，缓解形状歧义。方法可独立用于稀疏重建，也可作为NeuS、Neuralangelo等密集基线的插件增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在DTU上：相较SparseNeuS平均Chamfer Distance下降44%，相较VolRecon下降20%；作为插件用于NeuS与Neuralangelo时，平均误差分别下降69%与68%。实验验证了在稀疏与密集设置下的普适收益。

Conclusion: 语义场与几何掩码正则共同缓解稀疏视角下的辐射与形状歧义，提升重建精度与稳健性；方法通用、可插拔，对主流重建框架有显著增益。

Abstract: We propose a semantic-aware neural reconstruction method to generate 3D
high-fidelity models from sparse images. To tackle the challenge of severe
radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse input, we enrich
neural implicit representations by adding patch-based semantic logits that are
optimized together with the signed distance field and the radiance field. A
novel regularization based on the geometric primitive masks is introduced to
mitigate shape ambiguity. The performance of our approach has been verified in
experimental evaluation. The average chamfer distances of our reconstruction on
the DTU dataset can be reduced by 44% for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon. When
working as a plugin for those dense reconstruction baselines such as NeuS and
Neuralangelo, the average error on the DTU dataset can be reduced by 69% and
68% respectively.

### [5] [Automated Landfill Detection Using Deep Learning: A Comparative Study of Lightweight and Custom Architectures with the AerialWaste Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18315)
*Nowshin Sharmily,Rusab Sarmun,Muhammad E. H. Chowdhury,Mir Hamidul Hussain,Saad Bin Abul Kashem,Molla E Majid,Amith Khandakar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出用轻量级模型和集成方法在AerialWaste非法填埋场遥感数据上进行二分类，达到约92%的多项指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非法填埋场难以人工排查，存在公共安全与环境风险；公开高质量数据稀缺。作者希望借助深度学习在多源航拍数据上实现高效、可扩展的自动检测。

Method: 使用AerialWaste数据集（10434张，来自AGEA、WorldView-3、Google Earth），先比较多种模型，发现复杂大模型易过拟合；转而采用轻量级网络（MobileNetV2、GoogLeNet、DenseNet、MobileViT等），并通过集成与特征/概率融合来提升稳健性与性能，完成非法填埋场的二分类任务。

Result: 轻量级模型较重型模型过拟合更少；最佳模型集成后，二分类在该数据集上取得：Accuracy 92.33%，Precision 92.67%，Recall/Sensitivity 92.33%，F1 92.41%，Specificity 92.71%。

Conclusion: 在多源、质量不一的航拍图像上，轻量级网络更能泛化；通过集成与融合可在非法填埋场检测上达到稳定高性能，为资源受限场景与大规模部署提供可行方案。

Abstract: Illegal landfills are posing as a hazardous threat to people all over the
world. Due to the arduous nature of manually identifying the location of
landfill, many landfills go unnoticed by authorities and later cause dangerous
harm to people and environment. Deep learning can play a significant role in
identifying these landfills while saving valuable time, manpower and resources.
Despite being a burning concern, good quality publicly released datasets for
illegal landfill detection are hard to find due to security concerns. However,
AerialWaste Dataset is a large collection of 10434 images of Lombardy region of
Italy. The images are of varying qualities, collected from three different
sources: AGEA Orthophotos, WorldView-3, and Google Earth. The dataset contains
professionally curated, diverse and high-quality images which makes it
particularly suitable for scalable and impactful research. As we trained
several models to compare results, we found complex and heavy models to be
prone to overfitting and memorizing training data instead of learning patterns.
Therefore, we chose lightweight simpler models which could leverage general
features from the dataset. In this study, Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet,
MobileVit and other lightweight deep learning models were used to train and
validate the dataset as they achieved significant success with less
overfitting. As we saw substantial improvement in the performance using some of
these models, we combined the best performing models and came up with an
ensemble model. With the help of ensemble and fusion technique, binary
classification could be performed on this dataset with 92.33% accuracy, 92.67%
precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score and 92.71% specificity.

### [6] [Structures Meet Semantics: Multimodal Fusion via Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18322)
*Jiangfeng Sun,Sihao He,Zhonghong Ou,Meina Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SSU框架，通过结构+语义统一来改进多模态情感分析，构建模态特定图并用文本全局语义作为锚进行跨模态对齐，结合多视角对比学习，实现SOTA性能与更低计算开销并具可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态融合方法忽视模态内的结构依赖与跨模态语义错配，导致表示质量、可解释性与鲁棒性不足，需要一种能同时建模结构关系并统一语义空间的方法。

Method: 1) 动态构建模态特定图：文本用句法信息，音频/视觉用轻量文本引导注意力，捕获细粒度的模态内关系；2) 语义锚：由全局文本语义提取，作为跨模态对齐枢纽，统一异质语义空间；3) 多视角对比学习目标：促进区分性、语义一致性与结构连贯性，覆盖模态内与跨模态视角。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI与CMU-MOSEI上取得一致SOTA，同时相较以往方法显著降低计算开销；定性分析显示更强可解释性，能通过语义落地的交互捕获细腻情感模式。

Conclusion: 结构与语义的联合统一（SSU）可在保证效率的同时提升多模态情感分析的性能与可解释性，验证了模态特定结构建模与语义锚对齐及多视角对比学习的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to infer emotional states by
effectively integrating textual, acoustic, and visual modalities. Despite
notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect
modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting
their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU),
which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and
cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations.
Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging
linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism
for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal
relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic
anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal
alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across
modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective
that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence
across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used
benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing
computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative
analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture
nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.

### [7] [FastAvatar: Instant 3D Gaussian Splatting for Faces from Single Unconstrained Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18389)
*Hao Liang,Zhixuan Ge,Ashish Tiwari,Soumendu Majee,G. M. Dilshan Godaliyadda,Ashok Veeraraghavan,Guha Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastAvatar 是一个从单张任意姿态人脸图像快速生成3D高斯点云(3DGS)头像的前馈框架，<10ms 即时推理，兼顾身份保持与高质量重建，并支持潜空间的实时身份插值与属性编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS人脸生成在两端受限：前馈方法速度快但身份保持和跨姿态鲁棒性不足；基于优化的方法质量高却需数秒到数分钟，无法交互式应用。需要一种既快又准、对输入姿态不敏感、可编辑的单图人脸3DGS方案。

Method: 1) 由多视角人脸数据构建共享的3DGS“模板”模型；2) 设计编码器-解码器网络：编码器将任意姿态的单张人脸图像映射到姿态不变、身份相关的潜向量；解码器预测相对于模板中每个高斯的几何与外观参数残差；3) 采用纯前馈、仅回归残差以保障快速稳健推理；4) 特制潜空间结构，支持身份插值与属性控制。

Result: 在重建质量上显著优于现有前馈3DGS方法（如 GAGAvatar）；相较逐人优化的方法（如 FlashAvatar、GaussianAvatars、GASP），速度提升约1000倍；实现单张图<10ms生成并具备鲁棒的跨姿态身份保持。

Conclusion: FastAvatar 通过模板+残差的前馈范式与姿态不变潜空间，实现了高质量且超高速的单图3DGS人脸重建，并解锁实时编辑能力，适用于消费级与交互式头像应用场景。

Abstract: We present FastAvatar, a pose-invariant, feed-forward framework that can
generate a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from a single face image from an
arbitrary pose in near-instant time (<10ms). FastAvatar uses a novel
encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity
preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face
``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures.
Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and
pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict
residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the
template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion,
model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms
existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction
quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g.,
FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent
space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing
which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation
framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and
speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in
consumer and interactive systems.

### [8] [Securing Face and Fingerprint Templates in Humanitarian Biometric Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18415)
*Giuseppe Stragapede,Sam Merrick,Vedrana Krivokuća Hahn,Justin Sukaitis,Vincent Graf Narbel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在人道与应急环境中，作者构建了一套移动生物识别系统，并选用适合高风险场景的生物特征模板保护方案PolyProtect，结合高效的人脸特征提取器EdgeFace，在真实埃塞俄比亚数据上评估了验证/识别精度、不可逆性与不可链接性，并初步扩展到指纹；结果积极，代码将开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在人道救援与紧急场景中，生物识别可显著提升登记、发放与身份核验效率，但受助人处在高脆弱性之中，隐私与安全风险更高，需要既可用又能保护数据主体的模板保护技术。

Method: 1) 系统性定义这些场景的功能、运行、隐私与安全需求；2) 广泛比较BTP方法，基于有效性、模块化与计算开销选定PolyProtect；3) 采用高效的人脸嵌入提取器EdgeFace，在来自埃塞俄比亚的人脸数据上评估PolyProtect的验证与识别性能、模板不可逆性与不可链接性；4) 验证PolyProtect的模态无关性，首次将其用于指纹并进行识别场景评估。

Result: PolyProtect在移动端可行，结合EdgeFace在真实人道场景数据上取得良好的识别/验证精度，同时在不可逆性与不可链接性指标上表现积极；首次在指纹与识别任务上的实验同样显示出有前景的结果。

Conclusion: PolyProtect适合作为人道与应急环境的模板保护方案，具备有效性、轻量与可扩展到多模态的潜力；实验结果鼓舞人心，后续将开源代码以促进复现与应用。

Abstract: In humanitarian and emergency scenarios, the use of biometrics can
dramatically improve the efficiency of operations, but it poses risks for the
data subjects, which are exacerbated in contexts of vulnerability. To address
this, we present a mobile biometric system implementing a biometric template
protection (BTP) scheme suitable for these scenarios. After rigorously
formulating the functional, operational, and security and privacy requirements
of these contexts, we perform a broad comparative analysis of the BTP
landscape. PolyProtect, a method designed to operate on neural network face
embeddings, is identified as the most suitable method due to its effectiveness,
modularity, and lightweight computational burden. We evaluate PolyProtect in
terms of verification and identification accuracy, irreversibility, and
unlinkability, when this BTP method is applied to face embeddings extracted
using EdgeFace, a novel state-of-the-art efficient feature extractor, on a
real-world face dataset from a humanitarian field project in Ethiopia.
Moreover, as PolyProtect promises to be modality-independent, we extend its
evaluation to fingerprints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that PolyProtect has been evaluated for the identification scenario and
for fingerprint biometrics. Our experimental results are promising, and we plan
to release our code

### [9] [Why Relational Graphs Will Save the Next Generation of Vision Foundation Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18421)
*Fatemeh Ziaeetabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 主张在视觉基础模型中显式引入“动态关系图”作为关系接口，以提升需要实体/角色/时空关系推理的任务表现。通过跨领域例证（人类操作动作识别、脑肿瘤分割）展示该混合范式在精细语义、OOD鲁棒性、可解释性与效率方面优于仅用FM的基线，并提出面向图混合模型的研究议程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉FMs虽具强迁移能力，但在需要显式关系推理（实体、角色、空间与时间依赖）的任务上仍受限，如细粒度人类活动识别、第一视角视频理解、多模态医学影像等。作者认为要弥补此短板，需要在FM中引入可适配任务与输入的关系推理机制。

Method: 提出一种范式：在FM上叠加轻量级、上下文自适应的图推理模块，构建“动态关系图”（图拓扑与边语义由输入与任务上下文推断），并在不同领域进行实证对比。模块以稀疏语义节点进行推理，融入多层次关系（如部件-物体-场景或区域-器官）。

Result: 与仅FM基线相比，FM+动态图混合模型在精细语义保真度、分布外鲁棒性、可解释性与计算效率上均有提升；稀疏节点推理带来内存与硬件效率优势，利于资源受限部署。

Conclusion: 倡议下一代视觉FM采用图混合路线，并提出研究议程：学习式动态图构建、多层次关系推理、跨模态融合，以及直接评测关系能力的基准与协议。

Abstract: Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in
computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from
large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent
limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and
spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for
fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and
multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic
dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that
next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces,
instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge
semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this
position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation
action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs
with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves
fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness,
interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines.
Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also
achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under
practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for
FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level
relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or
region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols
that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.

### [10] [LPLC: A Dataset for License Plate Legibility Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18425)
*Lucas Wojcik,Gabriel E. Lima,Valfride Nascimento,Eduil Nascimento Jr.,Rayson Laroca,David Menotti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LPLC数据集与基线，聚焦车牌可读性分级与选择性预处理，以提升ALPR在低质车牌场景的效率与效果；三大基线F1<80%显示任务困难，亟需进一步研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ALPR在低清/遮挡/光照差导致的“不可读车牌”上表现差。通用的重建/超分会增加计算开销且未必必要，理想策略是仅对需要的样本做增强。因此需要一个带细粒度可读性标注的数据集与基准，支持“何时增强/何时放弃”的判定研究。

Method: 1) 构建LPLC数据集：10,210图像、12,687块车牌；涵盖多车型、光照、质量；细粒度标注包括车辆与车牌层面的遮挡、四档可读性（perfect/good/poor/illegible），以及除“不可读”外的字符标注。2) 任务定义：将车牌图像分类为“可直接识别/需超分/不可恢复”。3) 基线评估：选用ViT、ResNet、YOLO三类图像识别网络做可读性分类；并结合SR与LP识别方法做分析。

Result: 三种基线在该分类任务的整体F1均<80%，显示即便强大视觉模型在可读性判定上仍具挑战；SR与后续LP识别的结合分析表明，仅靠SR并不能彻底解决低质车牌的识别难题。

Conclusion: 可读性分级与选择性预处理是提升ALPR效率/鲁棒性的关键环节；LPLC提供了所需的数据与基基线，但当前性能仍不理想，鼓励社区在可读性估计、难例修复与端到端决策（增强或放弃）方面继续探索。

Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) faces a major challenge when
dealing with illegible license plates (LPs). While reconstruction methods such
as super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these
low-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and
computational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to
cases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we
introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687
annotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span
a wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality
levels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and
LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and
illegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible
LPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image
recognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires
super-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which
remained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO),
together with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the
difficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research. The
proposed dataset is publicly available at
https://github.com/lmlwojcik/lplc-dataset.

Motivation: 通用VLM在医疗场景存在两大痛点：1) 诊断专业性不足、易跑偏；2) 体量大、推理代价高，不利于临床部署。需要既可靠又高效的架构以提升专业诊断与可用性。

Method: 构建“专科-通才”层级框架：1) Specialist：轻量、领域训练的皮肤图像分类器，快速给出高精度诊断候选；2) Generalist：压缩后的对话式VLM，生成自然语言解答；3) 融合机制：用专科预测直接约束/引导通才的推理路径；4) 知识图谱检索：从皮肤科知识图谱检索证据以支撑与校准回答；5) 以多模态皮肤科数据集评测VQA任务。

Result: 与微调但未压缩的单线VLM基线相比：诊断准确率提升18%；平均显存占用下降≥20%；推理延迟下降≥5%。

Conclusion: 专科-通才协同并结合知识检索可同时提高医疗VQA的准确性与效率，提供一种轻量、可信、可临床落地的系统范式。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential for medical
tasks; however, their general-purpose nature can limit specialized diagnostic
accuracy, and their large size poses substantial inference costs for real-world
clinical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a
Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering
(VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image
classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic
predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the
Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In
our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's
reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further
enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the
Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both
accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic
errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on
our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an
18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a
fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM
requirement and latency by at least 20\% and 5\%, respectively. These results
indicate that a Specialist-Generalist system provides a practical and powerful
paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI
systems.

Abstract: Face images play a crucial role in numerous applications; however, real-world
conditions frequently introduce degradations such as noise, blur, and
compression artifacts, affecting overall image quality and hindering subsequent
tasks. To address this challenge, we organized the VQualA 2025 Challenge on
Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) as part of the ICCV 2025 Workshops.
Participants created lightweight and efficient models (limited to 0.5 GFLOPs
and 5 million parameters) for the prediction of Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) on
face images with arbitrary resolutions and realistic degradations. Submissions
underwent comprehensive evaluations through correlation metrics on a dataset of
in-the-wild face images. This challenge attracted 127 participants, with 1519
final submissions. This report summarizes the methodologies and findings for
advancing the development of practical FIQA approaches.

*Md. Rashid Shahriar Khan,Md. Abrar Hasan,Mohammod Tareq Aziz Justice*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个上下文感知的零样本视频异常检测框架，融合TimeSformer（时空特征）、DPC（未来预测偏差）与CLIP（语义概念与文本提示），通过InfoNCE/CPC联合训练与上下文门控，在无异常样本训练下对复杂场景中的未见行为进行检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频异常检测依赖已知异常样本或仅做低层时空偏差，难以覆盖开放世界中“异常”定义的多样性与上下文相关性。作者希望在无异常标注下，结合时序预测与语义理解，实现对未见异常的泛化。

Method: - 架构：三路混合流。1) TimeSformer提取时空特征；2) DPC对未来表示进行预测，比对预测与真实的偏差以发现时间异常；3) CLIP语义流，借助上下文相关的文本提示进行概念级异常判断。- 训练：使用InfoNCE与CPC损失，对齐视觉输入与其时间/语义表示；- 上下文门控：以场景线索或全局视频特征调制最终判断，做情境自适应融合。

Result: 能在零样本设置下检测未见行为，且在复杂环境中具备更强泛化与鲁棒性（摘要未给数值，但宣称性能提升与可泛化）。代码已开源。

Conclusion: 通过融合预测式时序建模与视觉-语言语义对齐，并辅以上下文门控，框架弥合了零样本异常检测中时间推理与语义上下文的鸿沟，适用于监控场景中开放集异常。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to
their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel
context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal
events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed
hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal
dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to
extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future
representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based
semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through
context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using
InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic
representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by
modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By
integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system
can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This
framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in
zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has
been made available at

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene flow estimation is critical for autonomous systems to
navigate dynamic environments safely, but creating the necessary large-scale,
manually annotated datasets remains a significant bottleneck for developing
robust perception models. Current self-supervised methods struggle to match the
performance of fully supervised approaches, especially in challenging
long-range and adverse weather scenarios, while supervised methods are not
scalable due to their reliance on expensive human labeling. We introduce
DoGFlow, a novel self-supervised framework that recovers full 3D object motions
for LiDAR scene flow estimation without requiring any manual ground truth
annotations. This paper presents our cross-modal label transfer approach, where
DoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time directly from 4D radar
Doppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware
association and ambiguity-resolved propagation. On the challenging MAN
TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised
methods and improves label efficiency by enabling LiDAR backbones to achieve
over 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of the ground truth
data. For more details, please visit https://ajinkyakhoche.github.io/DogFlow/

TL;DR: SatSkylines提出将卫星图像与粗几何先验结合，学习从带噪插值粗先验到精细建筑几何的变换，并发布Skylines-50K数据集，实现高质量、可控、泛化强的3D建筑生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仅依赖卫星顶视图的图像到3D方法难以恢复准确建筑结构；现有3D细化方法又需要高精度体素输入，面对简单先验（如长方体）失败。需要一种既能利用弱几何先验又能从图像中恢复细节的方案，并保持推理高效与可控。

Method: 1) 输入：卫星影像+粗几何先验（如插值并含噪的简单体块/多面体）；2) 学习一个从粗先验到精细几何的变换模型，实现细节生成与结构对齐；3) 通过建模“噪声→细节”的映射获得灵活几何控制而不增加额外计算；4) 构建Skylines-50K，大规模、风格化的3D建筑资产数据集用于训练/评估。

Result: 在广泛评测中，方法在结构准确性、细节丰富度与泛化能力上优于现有图像到3D与细化基线；能在简单几何先验下生成高质量建筑，并保持推理效率与可控性。

Conclusion: SatSkylines有效结合弱几何先验与卫星图像，学习从粗到细的几何变换，实现高保真、可控的3D建筑生成；Skylines-50K为该方向提供了重要数据基础。

Abstract: We present SatSkylines, a 3D building generation approach that takes
satellite imagery and coarse geometric priors. Without proper geometric
guidance, existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle to recover
accurate building structures from the top-down views of satellite images alone.
On the other hand, 3D detailization methods tend to rely heavily on highly
detailed voxel inputs and fail to produce satisfying results from simple priors
such as cuboids. To address these issues, our key idea is to model the
transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries,
enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. We
have further developed Skylines-50K, a large-scale dataset of over 50,000
unique and stylized 3D building assets in order to support the generations of
detailed building models. Extensive evaluations indicate the effectiveness of
our model and strong generalization ability.

TL;DR: 提出把单帧画面中检测可通行的空间转移点（STP）并选出主转移点（MSTP）作为新问题，给出两阶段深度学习基线：Faster R-CNN做STP检测、轻量选择器融合局部与全局特征做MSTP排序，并比较全量微调与适配器（adapter）迁移的权衡，建立数据集与评测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 玩家在复杂3D游戏中依赖视觉线索找到地图过渡点，自动制图与关卡提示需要可靠识别这些点；现有研究缺乏对“唯一关键路径转移点”的形式化与基线。

Method: 两阶段管线：1) 用Faster R-CNN检测候选STP；2) 轻量MSTP选择器融合局部（候选区域）与全局（整帧）视觉特征进行排序，含可选检索增强融合。两阶段均采用参数高效适配器；对比全量微调与仅适配器迁移。构建含5款ARPG的多样数据集并评测。

Result: 发现关键权衡：数据充足时，全量微调在STP检测上更优；低数据场景与MSTP选择任务中，适配器迁移更稳健更有效。基线性能与可行性得到验证。

Conclusion: 首次定义单帧STP检测与MSTP选择问题，提供数据集与基线管线及适配策略洞见，为AI导航辅助与数据驱动关卡设计工具奠定基础。

Abstract: In complex 3D game environments, players rely on visual affordances to spot
map transition points. Efficient identification of such points is important to
client-side auto-mapping, and provides an objective basis for evaluating map
cue presentation. In this work, we formalize the task of detecting traversable
Spatial Transition Points (STPs)-connectors between two sub regions-and
selecting the singular Main STP (MSTP), the unique STP that lies on the
designer-intended critical path toward the player's current macro-objective,
from a single game frame, proposing this as a new research focus. We introduce
a two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using
Faster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector that fuses
local and global visual features. Both stages benefit from parameter-efficient
adapters, and we further introduce an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step.
Our primary goal is to establish the feasibility of this problem and set
baseline performance metrics. We validate our approach on a custom-built,
diverse dataset collected from five Action RPG titles. Our experiments reveal a
key trade-off: while full-network fine-tuning produces superior STP detection
with sufficient data, adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and
effective in low-data scenarios and for the MSTP selection task. By defining
this novel problem, providing a baseline pipeline and dataset, and offering
initial insights into efficient model adaptation, we aim to contribute to
future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Wan-S2V，一种基于Wan的音频驱动角色动画模型，相比SOTA在影视级场景（复杂互动、身体动作、镜头调度）更具表现力与保真度，并在长视频生成与精确口型编辑中展现通用性，实验优于Hunyuan-Avatar与Omnihuman。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频驱动方法主要适用于语音/歌唱场景，难以满足影视制作对细腻互动、真实肢体运动、动态镜头等高要求，亟需能达成“电影级”表现的模型。

Method: 在Wan框架上构建音频到视频（speech-to-video）的模型Wan-S2V，面向复杂影视语境进行设计与训练；并设置与SOTA方法（Hunyuan-Avatar、Omnihuman）的系统性对比评测。同时展示两类应用：长时长视频生成与精确视频口型同步编辑。

Result: 在多项基准上持续优于对比方法，呈现更强的表现力与逼真度，尤其在电影化场景中的角色互动、身体动作与镜头表现方面效果更佳。

Conclusion: Wan-S2V在影视级音频驱动角色动画上显著领先现有方法，具备更高的表达性和保真度，并在长视频生成与口型编辑等任务中展现出较强的实用性与泛化能力。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for audio-driven character animation
demonstrate promising performance for scenarios primarily involving speech and
singing. However, they often fall short in more complex film and television
productions, which demand sophisticated elements such as nuanced character
interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work. To address
this long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation, we
propose an audio-driven model, which we refere to as Wan-S2V, built upon Wan.
Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in
cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive
experiments, benchmarking our method against cutting-edge models such as
Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate
that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions.
Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications
in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing.

### [18] [Decouple, Reorganize, and Fuse: A Multimodal Framework for Cancer Survival Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18632)
*Huayi Wang,Haochao Ying,Yuyang Xu,Qibo Qiu,Cheng Zhang,Danny Z. Chen,Ying Sun,Jian Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出用于癌症生存预测的DeReF框架：在模态解耦与动态MoE融合之间加入“随机特征重组”，并在解耦阶段用区域跨注意力；相较固定融合与传统MoE，提升特征组合多样性与信息交互，在LC与TCGA数据上验证有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态生存分析常见融合（拼接、注意力、MoE）存在两痛点：1）固定/静态的融合方案导致模型过度依赖预设组合，难以动态适配解耦特征；2）MoE通常让不同专家各管各的解耦特征，导致特征间信息闭塞、交互不足。

Method: 提出Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion（DeReF）：先用“模态解耦+区域跨注意力”得到更高质量的解耦特征；再在解耦与MoE融合之间引入“随机特征重组”策略，将不同模态/粒度的子特征随机重新组合，最后用动态MoE进行融合与生存时间预测。

Result: 在自有肝癌（LC）数据与三套TCGA公开数据上做了广泛实验，方法优于现有基线；显示泛化能力和对多模态信息交互的提升（具体指标未在摘要中给出）。

Conclusion: 随机重组+动态MoE可打破固定融合和MoE信息孤岛，提升解耦特征交互与泛化；区域跨注意力提高特征表示质量。方法在多数据集上验证有效，代码将开源。

Abstract: Cancer survival analysis commonly integrates information across diverse
medical modalities to make survival-time predictions. Existing methods
primarily focus on extracting different decoupled features of modalities and
performing fusion operations such as concatenation, attention, and MoE-based
(Mixture-of-Experts) fusion. However, these methods still face two key
challenges: i) Fixed fusion schemes (concatenation and attention) can lead to
model over-reliance on predefined feature combinations, limiting the dynamic
fusion of decoupled features; ii) in MoE-based fusion methods, each expert
network handles separate decoupled features, which limits information
interaction among the decoupled features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion framework (DeReF), which
devises a random feature reorganization strategy between modalities decoupling
and dynamic MoE fusion modules.Its advantages are: i) it increases the
diversity of feature combinations and granularity, enhancing the generalization
ability of the subsequent expert networks; ii) it overcomes the problem of
information closure and helps expert networks better capture information among
decoupled features. Additionally, we incorporate a regional cross-attention
network within the modality decoupling module to improve the representation
quality of decoupled features. Extensive experimental results on our in-house
Liver Cancer (LC) and three widely used TCGA public datasets confirm the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出ROSE框架，用合成数据和扩散Transformer实现“带副作用的视频目标移除”，覆盖阴影、反射、光照、半透明、镜面五类效应，并发布ROSE-Bench；在多场景上优于现有方法且能泛化到真实视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频目标移除多忽略或难以处理目标对环境的副作用（阴影、反射等），主要因缺乏成对视频监督数据，导致真实感差、残留明显、时序不一致。

Method: 1) 用3D渲染引擎构建全自动合成数据管线，生成含五类副作用的成对视频与差分掩码，覆盖多场景/物体/机位/轨迹；2) 以扩散Transformer为骨干的视频修复模型，输入整段视频做参考式擦除，显式预测并利用副作用区域（由成对视频差分得到）进行额外监督；3) 构建ROSE-Bench，含常规场景与五类特殊副作用测试集。

Result: 在ROSE-Bench与通用场景上，相比现有视频目标擦除/修复方法取得更优定量与视觉质量；对真实世界视频具有良好泛化。

Conclusion: 通过合成成对数据与显式副作用建模，ROSE系统性解决了目标移除中的环境副作用问题，在基准上显著领先并具备实际应用潜力；项目页提供资源与结果展示。

Abstract: Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent
success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects
of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to
eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.
This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework
that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be
categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency
and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the
aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data
generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data
preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,
objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an
video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all
object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for
reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to
explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed
through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate
the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new
benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five
special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results
demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video
object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios. The

TL;DR: 提出OwlCap模型，通过新数据集HMD-270K与基于GRPO的CSER奖励，平衡视频caption中的运动与细节，显著提升在细节与运动基准上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频描述模型在“运动信息”和“细节信息”之间失衡，导致描述不完整，影响下游的视频理解与生成一致性。

Method: 两方面改进：数据与优化。数据：构建HMD-270K，经两阶段流程——Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) 融合运动与细节标注；Fine-Grained Examination (FGE) 做细粒度质量筛查。优化：提出Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)，在Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) 框架下，通过单元到集合匹配与双向校验，强化同时覆盖运动与细节的完整性与准确性；先SFT于HMD-270K，再用GRPO+CSER后训练，得到OwlCap MLLM。

Result: 在两个基准上显著优于基线：VDC（偏细节）准确率提升+4.2，DREAM-1K（偏运动）F1提升+4.6，显示运动-细节平衡能力更强。

Conclusion: 通过高质量、平衡的数据与面向集合一致性的奖励优化，OwlCap实现更完整的多模态视频描述，并推动视频理解与生成的一致性；数据集与模型将开源，利于社区发展。

Abstract: Video captioning aims to generate comprehensive and coherent descriptions of
the video content, contributing to the advancement of both video understanding
and generation. However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail
imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the
other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a
lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this
issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed
the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage
pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2)
Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)
based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness
and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching
and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and
GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance.
Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements
compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2
Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap
model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research
community advancements.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于聚类的特征空间表示学习方法，用来自OBC字库的先验，通过聚类监督改进OBI拓片中的甲骨文检测，在Faster R-CNN、DETR、Sparse R-CNN上均显著提升性能。


<details>

Result: 在两个甲骨文检测数据集上，三种主流检测器均获得显著性能提升（摘要未给出具体数值，但强调“significant improvements”），表明该表示学习对不同架构具有普适增益。

Conclusion: 利用字库先验+聚类表征可有效缓解拓片退化带来的检测困难，改善特征判别性与鲁棒性；方法通用、可与多种检测框架兼容，适合数字考古场景的甲骨文自动检测。

Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBIs), play a crucial role in understanding ancient
Chinese civilization. The automated detection of OBIs from rubbing images
represents a fundamental yet challenging task in digital archaeology, primarily
due to various degradation factors including noise and cracks that limit the
effectiveness of conventional detection networks. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel clustering-based feature space representation learning
method. Our approach uniquely leverages the Oracle Bones Character (OBC) font
library dataset as prior knowledge to enhance feature extraction in the
detection network through clustering-based representation learning. The method
incorporates a specialized loss function derived from clustering results to
optimize feature representation, which is then integrated into the total
network loss. We validate the effectiveness of our method by conducting
experiments on two OBIs detection dataset using three mainstream detection
frameworks: Faster R-CNN, DETR, and Sparse R-CNN. Through extensive
experimentation, all frameworks demonstrate significant performance
improvements.

Motivation: N/A

Method: N/A

Result: N/A

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have
advanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks,
particularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce
wavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two
limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference,
and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while
suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the
frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for
better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior
Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight
key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT)
bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention
mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped
architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an
SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB,
EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and
0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in
underwater scenes.

TL;DR: 提出分层时空分割网络用于超声心动图左心室心内膜分割，通过结合局部细节与全局动态建模，显著提升射血分数（EF）估计的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法虽有较好分割，但EF估计偏差较大，原因在于仅单帧或仅多帧策略各有短板：单帧易累积局部误差，多帧易忽视细节，且超声噪声导致时空上下文利用不足。

Method: 设计分层时空网络：低层用卷积对单帧保细节，高层引入Mamba架构学习跨时空关系；提出时空交叉扫描（STCS）模块，通过跨帧与跨位置的跳跃式扫描融合长程上下文，缓解局部时空限制与噪声影响。

Result: 在EF估计上优于仅单帧或仅多帧的基线；分割性能保持或提升，同时显著降低由噪声引起的EF偏差（文中暗示对比与消融验证）。

Conclusion: 分层设计与STCS有效协同单帧细节与多帧动态，缓解误差累积与细节丢失问题，提升EF估计可靠性，适合噪声较强的超声视频。

Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good
segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation.
In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network
(\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation
accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception.
The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using
convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details,
while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture
spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame
and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation
when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only
multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the
Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context
through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate
EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.

Motivation: N/A

Method: N/A

Result: N/A

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Domain shift, characterized by degraded model performance during transition
from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, poses a persistent
challenge for deploying deep learning systems. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods predominantly rely on fine-tuning feature extractors -
an approach limited by inefficiency, reduced interpretability, and poor
scalability to modern architectures.
  Our analysis reveals that models pretrained on large-scale data exhibit
domain-invariant geometric patterns in their feature space, characterized by
intra-class clustering and inter-class separation, thereby preserving
transferable discriminative structures. These findings indicate that domain
shifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature
degradation.
  Unlike fine-tuning entire pre-trained models - which risks introducing
unpredictable feature distortions - we propose the Feature-space Planes
Searcher (FPS): a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision
boundaries by leveraging these geometric patterns while keeping the feature
encoder frozen. This streamlined approach enables interpretative analysis of
adaptation while substantially reducing memory and computational costs through
offline feature extraction, permitting full-dataset optimization in a single
computation cycle.
  Evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that FPS achieves competitive or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods. FPS scales efficiently with
multimodal large models and shows versatility across diverse domains including
protein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, and earthquake
detection. We anticipate FPS will provide a simple, effective, and
generalizable paradigm for transfer learning, particularly in domain adaptation
tasks. .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种用于人体行为识别（HAR）的轻量级混合深度学习框架：InceptionV3 提取空间特征 + LSTM 建模时序 + 带注意力与自适应动态适应度共享（ADFSA）的集成遗传算法做特征选择；在 UCF‑YouTube 上达 99.65% 准确率，最少仅保留 7 个特征，提升推理速度，适合边缘设备实时部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 HAR 系统在实际场景中常受高计算开销、冗余特征、实时性与可扩展性差等问题限制，尤其在背景杂乱、遮挡、光照差、运动复杂等条件下难以稳定工作。作者希望在保证高准确率的同时，显著减少特征冗余与计算负担，使模型能在树莓派等资源受限设备上实时运行。

Method: 三段式融合：1）自定义 InceptionV3 作为空间编码器，捕获多尺度上下文、区域一致性与细粒度定位线索；2）LSTM 编码跨帧时序，建模运动动态；3）提出带注意力的集成遗传算法（ADFSA），结合自适应动态适应度共享，联合优化多目标（准确率、冗余、唯一性、复杂度），选择紧凑且判别性强的特征子集；随后将所选特征馈入多种轻量分类器以实现鲁棒识别。

Result: 在具有遮挡、背景杂乱、光照差与复杂运动的 UCF‑YouTube 数据集上，方法达到 99.65% 识别率；特征维度可压缩到最低 7 个；推理时间显著提升（更快），并在异构环境下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 所提混合框架在准确率、紧凑性与速度上兼顾，具备轻量与可扩展特性，能够在树莓派等边缘设备实时部署，适用于公共安全、辅助技术与自主监测等资源感知场景。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in various
applications, including smart surveillance, healthcare, assistive technologies,
sports analytics, etc. However, HAR systems still face critical challenges,
including high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability
in real-time scenarios. An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is
introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and
a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first
extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which
captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained
localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled
using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based
genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA)
is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically
balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity
reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse
and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to
achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental
results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as
occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination,
demonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition
accuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time. The
lightweight and scalable nature of the HAR system supports real-time deployment
on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, enabling practical applications in
intelligent, resource-aware environments, including public safety, assistive
technology, and autonomous monitoring systems.

*Qun Ji,Peng Li,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出 ColorGS 框架，通过可适应空间的颜色编码与增强形变模型，实现内镜视频中软组织的高保真重建，显著提升纹理与全局形变一致性，并保持实时渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 3DGS 动态重建在手术场景下两大瓶颈：1) 每个高斯固定颜色难以表达细微颜色/纹理与复杂光照下的变化；2) 线性形变难以兼顾局部组织变形与手术交互导致的全局一致运动。临床上需要既高保真又实时的重建用于术中导航与 AR/VR。

Method: ColorGS 包含两点核心改进：
- 有色高斯基元（Colored Gaussian Primitives）：为每个高斯引入动态锚点与可学习颜色参数，进行空间自适应颜色编码，更好刻画空间非均匀纹理与光照变化。
- 增强形变模型（EDM）：结合“时间感知的高斯基函数”与“可学习的时间无关形变”。前者拟合时变的局部组织形变，后者保证跨时间的全局运动一致性；两者共同建模局部与全局的动态。

Result: 在达芬奇手术视频与 EndoNeRF、StereoMIS 基准上达到 SOTA：PSNR 39.85（较 3DGS 系列+1.5dB），SSIM 97.25%，并维持实时渲染效率。

Conclusion: ColorGS 通过颜色表达与形变建模的协同改进，实现手术场景的高保真、实时三维重建，适用于术中指导与 AR/VR 等应用。

Abstract: High-fidelity reconstruction of deformable tissues from endoscopic videos
remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing
subtle color variations and modeling global deformations. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed
per-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear
deformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address
these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially
adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene
reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ
dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially
varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex
lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model
(EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable
time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized
tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical
interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and
benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves
state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior
3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\%) while maintaining real-time
rendering efficiency. Our work advances surgical scene reconstruction by
balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, critical for
intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.

*Hiroaki Aizawa,Yuta Naito,Kohei Fukuda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出“按类别的flooding正则化”，在不平衡数据上为每个类别设置不同的flooding阈值，以抑制多数类过拟合、保障少数类学习，从而提升少数类与总体泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不平衡数据训练时，模型偏向多数类，少数类识别性能显著下降。现有flooding在全局设定单一阈值，无法兼顾多数/少数类的不同学习需求。需要一种能够因类制宜地控制过拟合与欠拟合的正则策略。

Method: 将flooding正则扩展到类别层面：为每个类别根据其样本频次分配独立的flooding level（阈值）。多数类采用较高阈值以阻止训练损失过低、避免记忆；少数类采用较低阈值以允许更充分的优化。以此在训练过程中对不同类别的损失下限进行差异化约束。

Result: 在不平衡图像分类任务上，相比传统（全局统一阈值的）flooding，所提方法提升了少数类分类指标，并带来更好的总体泛化表现。

Conclusion: 类别自适应的flooding能更好平衡多数类的正则与少数类的学习强度，从而缓解类别不平衡带来的偏置，改善少数类性能并提升总体表现。

Abstract: The purpose of training neural networks is to achieve high generalization
performance on unseen inputs. However, when trained on imbalanced datasets, a
model's prediction tends to favor majority classes over minority classes,
leading to significant degradation in the recognition performance of minority
classes. To address this issue, we propose class-wise flooding regularization,
an extension of flooding regularization applied at the class level. Flooding is
a regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by preventing the
training loss from falling below a predefined threshold, known as the flooding
level, thereby discouraging memorization. Our proposed method assigns a
class-specific flooding level based on class frequencies. By doing so, it
suppresses overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning
for minority classes. We validate our approach on imbalanced image
classification. Compared to conventional flooding regularizations, our method
improves the classification performance of minority classes and achieves better
overall generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: N/A

Method: N/A

Result: N/A

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Neural networks trained by empirical risk minimization often suffer from
overfitting, especially to specific samples or domains, which leads to poor
generalization. Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this issue by selecting
training samples based on the difficulty. From the optimization perspective,
methods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improve robustness and
generalization by seeking flat minima. However, combining CL with SAM is not
straightforward. In flat regions, both the loss values and the gradient norms
tend to become uniformly small, which makes it difficult to evaluate sample
difficulty and design an effective curriculum. To overcome this problem, we
propose the Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM), which quantifies adversarial
vulnerability by leveraging the robustness properties of models trained toward
flat minima. Unlike loss- or gradient-based measures, which become ineffective
as training progresses into flatter regions, ADM remains informative by
measuring the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. We
incorporate ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample
difficulty. We evaluated our approach on image classification tasks,
fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization. The results demonstrate
that our method preserves the strengths of both CL and SAM while outperforming
existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies.

*Melanie Wille,Tobias Fischer,Scarlett Raine*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究将水下目标检测任务拆解为定位与分类两部分，发现瓶颈主要在前景-背景区分（定位阶段），即使数据均衡后分类精度仍存在差距，说明存在内在特征难度与类间依赖。建议：若重视精度用不均衡分布，若重视召回用均衡分布；提升弱势类别应侧重改进定位模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下场景成像退化、类别不均衡与独特外观导致检测难；不同物种检测效果差异大，但成因不明。作者希望回答：除了数据量外，是什么导致类特定性能差异？以及如何系统性提升表现不佳的物种检测。

Method: 基于DUO数据集，作者人为构造与操控数据分布，将检测任务拆解为定位与分类两阶段：1）用YOLO11并配合TIDE误差分解分析定位错误来源；2）在控制类别平衡的条件下做分类实验，评估精度/召回与类间依赖；重点分析扇贝（scallop）类别的弱势表现。

Result: 定位分析表明，无论数据量多少，前景-背景判别是最主要问题；分类实验在平衡数据下仍存在稳定的精度差距，显示挑战来自内在特征与类间依赖，而非仅是数据稀缺。

Conclusion: 当优先精度时采用不均衡分布，当优先召回时采用均衡分布；改进弱势类别应优先从算法层面，尤其是定位模块着手。作者开源代码与数据。

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but
poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class
distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is
detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key
research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific
performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of
under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the
object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the
under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and
TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic
stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent
precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based
challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend
imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced
distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes
should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules.
We publicly release our code and datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 1) 将任务重构为seq2seq：以矢量图元序列驱动参数化CAD操作序列生成；2) 设计“网络友好”的矢量图元表示，保留精确几何信息；3) 双解码器Transformer：解耦命令类型与参数生成，并保持两者精确对应；4) 软目标分布损失：容纳CAD参数的固有多解与灵活性；5) 构建CAD-VGDrawing配对数据集用于训练与评估。

Result: 在CAD-VGDrawing上进行全面实验，方法在从2D工程图到参数化CAD的生成任务上表现优异，能更好保持几何精度和设计意图（相较于现有方法）。代码与数据集已公开。

Conclusion: 将绘图到CAD转化为seq2seq并结合双解码与软目标损失是有效范式，能在工业工作流中更自然地从2D工程图生成精确的参数化模型；数据集与开源实现为后续研究提供基准。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant
innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable
progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds,
meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge
from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings.
The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings
remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To
address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly
inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric
precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose
Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a
network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise
geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples
command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence,
and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility
in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing,
a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct
thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/lllssc/Drawing2CAD.

Motivation: N/A

Method: N/A

Result: N/A

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments remains
challenging, as existing systems struggle to estimate audio reliability and
dynamically adjust modality reliance. We propose router-gated cross-modal
feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and
visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an
audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable
audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each
decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when
audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach
achieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to
AV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism
contribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.

*Qinqian Lei,Bo Wang,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个面向VLM与专用HOI方法的全新基准与评测协议：将HOI检测重构为“多答案多选题”，只提供正例选项，并精心挑选无歧义负例，以避免因语义多样性而错误惩罚正确预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HOI基准（如HICO-DET）要求与标注类别精确匹配，不适配生成式VLM的开放表述与多义性，导致在存在合理多解（如扔/接飞盘）时把有效预测判错，从而不公平地评估VLM与专用HOI模型。作者希望建立一个能公平比较通用VLM与专用HOI方法的评测框架。

Method: 将HOI检测任务重构为多答案多选题：每个问题只包含来自标注的正向选项，并构造经人工或规则筛选的、减少歧义的负向选项（避免把语义近邻如“throwing”与“catching”互设为负）。该协议同时适用于生成式VLM与判别式HOI模型，可直接对比。

Result: 实现了首个面向VLM与HOI方法统一评测的基准与协议，能更准确反映模型在含歧义HOI场景下的真实能力，避免对合理预测的误罚；据称带来更具解释力的比较与新的洞见。

Conclusion: 现有精确匹配评测与生成式VLM不相容，易误罚。新基准通过多答案多选与谨慎负例构造，公平评估并直接比较VLM与HOI方法，为HOI理解研究提供更可靠的进展衡量。

Abstract: Prior human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods have integrated early
vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, but only as supporting components
within their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs
suggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand
images involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can
general-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do
they compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark
that can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as
HICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their
evaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is
poorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple
valid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may
capture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted
as either "throwing" or "catching". When only "catching" is annotated, the
other, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact
matching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,
affecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid
predictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a
multiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only
ground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are
constructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when "catching" is annotated, "throwing"
is not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The
proposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI
methods, enabling direct comparison and offering new insight into the current
state of progress in HOI understanding.

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a crucial role in fostering deep
thinking and knowledge integration in education. However, previous research has
primarily focused on generating MCQs with textual options, but it largely
overlooks the visual options. Moreover, generating high-quality distractors
remains a major challenge due to the high cost and limited scalability of
manual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Options
Synthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual
options. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning
process and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically
plausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a
discrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options.
Experimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in
content discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over
existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.

Abstract: The growing integration of smart environments and low-power computing
devices, coupled with mass-market sensor technologies, is driving advancements
in remote and non-contact physiological monitoring. However, deploying these
systems in real-time on resource-constrained platforms introduces significant
challenges related to scalability, interoperability, and performance. This
paper presents a real-time remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) system optimized
for low-power devices, designed to extract physiological signals, such as heart
rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2), from facial
video streams. The system is built on the Face2PPG pipeline, which processes
video frames sequentially for rPPG signal extraction and analysis, while
leveraging a multithreaded architecture to manage video capture, real-time
processing, network communication, and graphical user interface (GUI) updates
concurrently. This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames
per second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface
to guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both
an HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand
vital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of
low-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional
Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven
processing and efficient task parallelization. The system is evaluated under
real-time constraints, demonstrating robustness while minimizing computational
overhead. Our work addresses key challenges in real-time biosignal monitoring,
offering practical solutions for optimizing performance in modern healthcare
and human-computer interaction applications.

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Online mapping models show remarkable results in predicting vectorized maps
from multi-view camera images only. However, all existing approaches still rely
on ground-truth high-definition maps during training, which are expensive to
obtain and often not geographically diverse enough for reliable generalization.
In this work, we propose PseudoMapTrainer, a novel approach to online mapping
that uses pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled sensor data. We derive those
pseudo-labels by reconstructing the road surface from multi-camera imagery
using Gaussian splatting and semantics of a pre-trained 2D segmentation
network. In addition, we introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss
function to handle partially masked pseudo-labels, allowing for the first time
the training of online mapping models without any ground-truth maps.
Furthermore, our pseudo-labels can be effectively used to pre-train an online
model in a semi-supervised manner to leverage large-scale unlabeled
crowdsourced data. The code is available at

Abstract: Effective waste sorting is critical for sustainable recycling, yet AI
research in this domain continues to lag behind commercial systems due to
limited datasets and reliance on legacy object detectors. In this work, we
advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and
introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first
benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on
the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts
perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy.
Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern

propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using
spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised

### [37] [Embedding Font Impression Word Tags Based on Co-occurrence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18825)
*Yugo Kubota,Seiichi Uchida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于“字体形状—印象”关系的标签嵌入：用共现图+谱嵌入为印象标签生成向量，较BERT/CLIP更适合印象驱动的字体生成与检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用词向量（BERT/CLIP）在表达“印象标签”相似性时常不匹配视觉形状的共现关系，导致印象引导的字体生成/检索效果不佳。需要一种能直接反映字体印象共现与相似性的专用嵌入。

Method: 收集印象标签与字体的共现数据；构建以标签为节点、以共现关系为边的图；对该图做谱嵌入（如拉普拉斯特征分解）生成低维印象向量，使高共现标签在向量空间相近；将该嵌入用于印象驱动的字体生成与检索模块。

Result: 与BERT、CLIP生成的词向量相比，该谱嵌入在定性可视化上更符合人类对印象相近性的直觉；在定量评测（印象引导的字体生成与检索指标）上取得更优表现。

Conclusion: 利用标签共现图的谱嵌入能更好捕捉字体“形状—印象”的内在结构，优于通用语义嵌入，并提升印象指导的字体生成与检索效果。

Abstract: Different font styles (i.e., font shapes) convey distinct impressions,
indicating a close relationship between font shapes and word tags describing
those impressions. This paper proposes a novel embedding method for impression
tags that leverages these shape-impression relationships. For instance, our
method assigns similar vectors to impression tags that frequently co-occur in
order to represent impressions of fonts, whereas standard word embedding
methods (e.g., BERT and CLIP) yield very different vectors. This property is
particularly useful for impression-based font generation and font retrieval.
Technically, we construct a graph whose nodes represent impression tags and
whose edges encode co-occurrence relationships. Then, we apply spectral
embedding to obtain the impression vectors for each tag. We compare our method
with BERT and CLIP in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating
that our approach performs better in impression-guided font generation.

*Takayuki Ishikawa,Carmelo Bonannella,Bas J. W. Lerink,Marc Rußwurm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 用公开的遥感时序大模型提取深度特征并小样本微调，可将荷兰NFI树种分类精度相比传统手工特征+随机森林提升约10%，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NFI提供关键的树种分布信息，但人工外业更新代价高；传统基于卫星时序的树种识别多依赖手工特征与RF分类器，表达力有限。希望利用预训练的遥感基础模型在小样本条件下提高分类精度并降低维护成本。

Method: 从GEE提取Sentinel‑1/2、ERA5与SRTM多源时空数据；采用公开的遥感时序基础模型获取深度表征，并在少量标注数据上进行微调；与现有基于手工谐波特征+RF的SOTA方法在荷兰NFI数据上进行系统对比评估。

Result: 微调后的时序基础模型在所有数据集上均显著超越SOTA，最大提升可达约10%分类精度；证明深度时序特征优于手工谐波特征，尤其在标注稀缺情形下更具优势。

Conclusion: 基于开放卫星数据与预训练时序基础模型的深度特征可有效改进NFI树种分类，能作为传统清查流程的有力补充；未来应进一步探索多源数据融合与跨区域迁移泛化能力。

Abstract: National Forest Inventory (NFI)s serve as the primary source of forest
information, providing crucial tree species distribution data. However,
maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns.
Remote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning,
offer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While
the use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing
tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches
rely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and
phenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained
remote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These
pre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for
general-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with
smaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work
systematically investigates how deep features improve tree species
classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise,
we extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites
data and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that
fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model
outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the
Netherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This
demonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for
this task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for
data-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly
available satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly
improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can
effectively complement existing forest inventory processes.

TL;DR: 基于ConvNeXt V2、中心裁剪与5折集成，用于NMF/AMF二分类；通过应对类别不平衡与跨域差异，获得稳健表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在病理图像中区分正常与非典型有丝分裂像对诊断和预后重要，但存在类别极不平衡、形态差异大、跨物种/肿瘤类型/扫描仪域偏移等挑战，需要一个在多域数据上鲁棒且高效的自动分类方案。

Method: 采用ConvNeXt V2作为骨干；输入做60%中心裁剪以聚焦细胞主体；使用混合精度训练提升效率；通过5折交叉验证训练多个模型并进行集成，以缓解数据偏差与提升泛化。

Abstract: This paper presents our solution for the MIDOG 2025 Challenge Track 2, which
focuses on binary classification of normal mitotic figures (NMFs) versus
atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) in histopathological images. Our approach
leverages a ConvNeXt V2 base model with center cropping preprocessing and
5-fold cross-validation ensemble strategy. The method addresses key challenges
including severe class imbalance, high morphological variability, and domain
heterogeneity across different tumor types, species, and scanners. Through
strategic preprocessing with 60% center cropping and mixed precision training,
our model achieved robust performance on the diverse MIDOG 2025 dataset. The
solution demonstrates the effectiveness of modern convolutional architectures
for mitotic figure subtyping while maintaining computational efficiency through
careful architectural choices and training optimizations.

*Zizheng Guo,Bochao Zou,Yinuo Jia,Xiangyu Li,Huimin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种先验引导的视频级回归方法来同时进行微表情定位与识别，通过可扩展区间选择和协同优化，在多个数据集上达到了SOTA（CAS(ME)^3: STRS 0.0562；SAMMLV: 0.2000）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多采用固定窗口的窗口级分类与硬判决，难以刻画微表情低强度、短时长、复杂时序演化；即便视频级回归出现，也仍依赖手工预定义的基于窗口的区间解码，无法精确定位onset/apex/offset。

Method: 1) 先验引导的视频级回归：融合微表情在时序演化、持续时长、类别分布等先验，设计可扩展的区间选择策略，精确选取候选区间并解码onset/apex/offset；2) 协同优化框架：定位（spotting）与识别（recognition）共享除分类头外的参数，实现信息互补与小数据高效训练；3) 端到端训练与区间回归解码，避免固定窗口与手工规则。

Result: 在多个基准上达成SOTA，STRS指标CAS(ME)^3为0.0562，SAMMLV为0.2000，并给出开源代码链接。

Conclusion: 利用先验引导的区间选择与定位-识别协同优化，可更好建模微表情的细粒度时序与稀疏性，提升定位与识别精度与数据效率，优于基于固定窗口或纯手工区间解码的方案。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary, low-intensity, and short-duration
facial expressions that often reveal an individual's genuine thoughts and
emotions. Most existing ME analysis methods rely on window-level classification
with fixed window sizes and hard decisions, which limits their ability to
capture the complex temporal dynamics of MEs. Although recent approaches have
adopted video-level regression frameworks to address some of these challenges,
interval decoding still depends on manually predefined, window-based methods,
leaving the issue only partially mitigated. In this paper, we propose a
prior-guided video-level regression method for ME analysis. We introduce a
scalable interval selection strategy that comprehensively considers the
temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics of MEs,
enabling precise spotting of the onset, apex, and offset phases. In addition,
we introduce a synergistic optimization framework, in which the spotting and
recognition tasks share parameters except for the classification heads. This
fully exploits complementary information, makes more efficient use of limited
data, and enhances the model's capability. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with an STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)$^3$ and 0.2000 on SAMMLV. The code is

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Microsurgical anastomosis demands exceptional dexterity and visuospatial
skills, underscoring the importance of comprehensive training and precise
outcome assessment. Currently, methods such as the outcome-oriented anastomosis
lapse index are used to evaluate this procedure. However, they often rely on
subjective judgment, which can introduce biases that affect the reliability and
efficiency of the assessment of competence. Leveraging three datasets from
hospitals with participants at various levels, we introduce a quantitative
framework that uses image-processing techniques for objective assessment of
microsurgical anastomoses. The approach uses geometric modeling of errors along
with a detection and scoring mechanism, enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of microsurgical proficiency assessment and advancing training
protocols. The results show that the geometric metrics effectively replicate
expert raters' scoring for the errors considered in this work.

*Muhammad Kashif Ali,Eun Woo Im,Dongjin Kim,Tae Hyun Kim,Vivek Gupta,Haonan Luo,Tianrui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种在测试时对像素级合成视频稳像模型进行快速自适应的方法，利用低层视觉线索与高抖动（jerk）定位与定向自适应，在保持全帧输出的同时显著提升稳定性与画质，并跨多数据集与多模型取得一致改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全帧像素级视频稳像方法虽能生成稳定视频，但因不同视频的运动模式和内容多样，固定参数难以泛化；同时希望保留现代方法的全帧优点与用户可控性，超越传统SOTA稳定器。

Method: 在推理阶段对现有全帧合成稳像模型进行“快速自适应”（test-time adaptation），利用输入视频的低层视觉线索进行一次或少量自适应更新；提出“jerk定位模块”检测高抖动片段，并采用“定向自适应策略”将更新集中于这些片段，以更少步骤获得更大稳定性提升；提供类似传统方法的用户控制机制。

Result: 单次自适应即可带来显著增益；在多个真实世界数据集上，对多种全帧合成稳像模型进行增强，定性与定量指标均提升；对下游任务（未具体指明，可能如跟踪/识别）也带来更好表现。

Conclusion: 测试时快速自适应结合高抖动定位与定向优化，能在保持全帧输出与用户可控性的同时，稳定性与画质超越传统SOTA，并具有跨数据集与模型的通用性。

Abstract: Video stabilization remains a fundamental problem in computer vision,
particularly pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization, which
synthesize full-frame outputs, add to the complexity of this task. These
methods aim to enhance stability while synthesizing full-frame videos, but the
inherent diversity in motion profiles and visual content present in each video
sequence makes robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. To
address this, we present a novel method that improves pixel-level synthesis
video stabilization methods by rapidly adapting models to each input video at
test time. The proposed approach takes advantage of low-level visual cues
available during inference to improve both the stability and visual quality of
the output. Notably, the proposed rapid adaptation achieves significant
performance gains even with a single adaptation pass. We further propose a jerk
localization module and a targeted adaptation strategy, which focuses the
adaptation on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation
steps. The proposed methodology enables modern stabilizers to overcome the
longstanding SOTA approaches while maintaining the full frame nature of the
modern methods, while offering users with control mechanisms akin to classical
approaches. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate
the versatility of the proposed method. Our approach consistently improves the
performance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and
quantitative terms, including results on downstream applications.

Motivation: N/A

Method: N/A

Result: N/A

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Ensuring fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis is essential
for equitable healthcare, particularly under distribution shifts caused by
variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice. Vision-language models
(VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity
attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive
directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and
text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and
fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal
prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal
representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that
separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned
representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are
constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to
produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related
information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode
dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is
applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and
strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves
state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution
settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with
only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: N/A

Result: N/A

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection focuses on localizing human-object
pairs and recognizing their interactions. Recently, the DETR-based framework
has been widely adopted in HOI detection. In DETR-based HOI models, queries
with clear meaning are crucial for accurately detecting HOIs. However, prior
works have typically relied on randomly initialized queries, leading to vague
representations that limit the model's effectiveness. Meanwhile, humans in the
HOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable.
Therefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object
and interaction queries. Specifically, object queries are enhanced with
object-aware encoder features, enabling the model to focus more effectively on
humans interacting with objects in an object-aware way. On the other hand, we
design a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates
that are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance
the initialization of interaction queries, thereby improving the model's
ability to understand interactions. Furthermore, we introduce an Auxiliary
Prediction Unit aimed at improving the representation of interaction features.
Our proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the HICO-Det and
the V-COCO datasets. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶虽可直接从原始传感输入输出控制指令，但其深度网络具有强非线性且难以解释，特别在城市复杂路况下难以理解决策依据，影响信任与部署安全。因此，需要在不牺牲性能的前提下提升模型可解释性，并检验可解释性与安全性能（如违规率）之间的关联。

Method: 设计新的可解释性导向损失函数，鼓励模型产生稀疏、空间局部化的特征图；利用这些特征激活来可视化并解释图像中驱动控制输出（转向、加减速）的关键区域；进行了特征提取阶段的消融实验；在CARLA基准上评估单目、非集成的端到端控制模型。

Result: 在CARLA基准上，相比排行榜顶尖方法，所提单目非集成模型得到更低的违规（infraction）分数与最高路径完成率；消融实验表明可解释性导向的特征稀疏/局部化有助于性能提升；特征激活可稳定定位与控制相关的图像区域。

Conclusion: 可解释性可通过训练目标显式优化，而非仅做事后可视化；提升可解释性的稀疏、局部化特征与安全性能（更少违规）正相关；方法在不依赖多传感器或集成的情况下即达最先进性能，并提供可审计的决策依据，促进可信自动驾驶落地。

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles.
Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data,
interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban
scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with
non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind
AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability
while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we
propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by
generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us
to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We
conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and
validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our
approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions,
yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular,
non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA
Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route
completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

Abstract: The Event-Enriched Image Analysis (EVENTA) Grand Challenge, hosted at ACM
Multimedia 2025, introduces the first large-scale benchmark for event-level
multimodal understanding. Traditional captioning and retrieval tasks largely
focus on surface-level recognition of people, objects, and scenes, often
overlooking the contextual and semantic dimensions that define real-world
events. EVENTA addresses this gap by integrating contextual, temporal, and
semantic information to capture the who, when, where, what, and why behind an
image. Built upon the OpenEvents V1 dataset, the challenge features two tracks:
Event-Enriched Image Retrieval and Captioning, and Event-Based Image Retrieval.
A total of 45 teams from six countries participated, with evaluation conducted
through Public and Private Test phases to ensure fairness and reproducibility.
The top three teams were invited to present their solutions at ACM Multimedia
2025. EVENTA establishes a foundation for context-aware, narrative-driven
multimedia AI, with applications in journalism, media analysis, cultural
archiving, and accessibility. Further details about the challenge are available

Motivation: 在人群动力学与空间设计中，群体与单人行走者在空间占用与交互行为上存在系统性差异，但缺乏统一、可扩展的自动识别与量化框架来支撑大规模数据分析与模型校准。

Method: 1) 将多行人轨迹按固定时间窗口分段；2) 基于Transformer的“轨迹对”二分类模型判定是否为同一群体成员；3) 通过序列化的过滤流程识别稳定群体与单人；4) 构建指标体系：空间（凸包面积、最小外接圆半径、热力密度）与行为（速度变化、运动角偏差、避让清径半径、轨迹直线度）；5) 定义相遇类型：单-单、单-群、群-群；6) 针对不同序列长度（60/100/200帧）搭建可扩展数据结构。

Result: 当前成果为一条可运行的分类与数据组织管线，能从真实轨迹中区分群体与单人，并输出用于后续量化分析的结构化指标与相遇类型标签；尚未给出指标的完整统计与对比结论。

Conclusion: 工作主要贡献在于：提供可扩展的群体识别方法与度量框架，标准化空间/行为指标与相遇类型分类，为后续在不同时间尺度上的量化评估、行人仿真校准与空间设计验证奠定基础；未来将补充系统的定量分析与应用验证。

Abstract: This study presents an initial framework for distinguishing group and single
pedestrians based on real-world trajectory data, with the aim of analyzing
their differences in space utilization and emergent behavioral patterns. By
segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a
Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and
isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process.
To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework
incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization
metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and
heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types
occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change,
motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are
designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions.
Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single,
single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different
interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the
classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork
for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200
frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the
proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space
design validation in crowd dynamics research.

Conclusion: 该方法以低成本、可扩展的流程实现高分辨率珊瑚礁监测，融合低成本数据采集、弱监督深度学习与多尺度遥感，为大尺度生态监测与保护提供实用工具。

Abstract: Monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales remains an open challenge,
essential for assessing ecosystem health and informing conservation efforts.
While drone-based aerial imagery offers broad spatial coverage, its limited
resolution makes it difficult to reliably distinguish fine-scale classes, such
as coral morphotypes. At the same time, obtaining pixel-level annotations over
large spatial extents is costly and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability
of deep learning-based segmentation methods for aerial imagery. We present a
multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that addresses
this challenge by transferring fine-scale ecological information from
underwater imagery to aerial data. Our method enables large-scale coral reef
mapping from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation, combining
classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation and self-distillation
techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, enabling large-area
segmentation of coral morphotypes and demonstrating flexibility for integrating
new classes. This study presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for
high-resolution reef monitoring, combining low-cost data collection, weakly
supervised deep learning and multi-scale remote sensing.

due to limited control over spatial composition and semantic layout. To address
this, we integrate vector data to guide map generation in different styles,
specified by the textual prompts. Our model is the first to generate accurate
maps in controlled styles, and we have integrated it into a web application to
improve its usability and accessibility. We conducted a user study with
professional cartographers to assess the fidelity of generated maps, the
usability of the web application, and the implications of ever-emerging GenAI
in map-making. The findings have suggested the potential of our developed
application and, more generally, the GenAI models in helping both non-expert
users and professionals in creating maps more efficiently. We have also
outlined further technical improvements and emphasized the new role of
cartographers to advance the paradigm of AI-assisted map-making.

### [50] [Enhancing compact convolutional transformers with super attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18960)
*Simpenzwe Honore Leandre,Natenaile Asmamaw Shiferaw,Dillip Rout*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种用于固定上下文长度视觉任务的新模型，结合token混合、序列池化和卷积式tokenizer，在CIFAR100上以更小模型与更高训练稳定性达到SOTA级别，并在短上下文场景优于SDPA Transformer。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer在固定上下文、短序列视觉任务上计算开销大、对位置编码与训练技巧依赖强，且在小型数据集/模型规模下泛化与稳定性不足。作者希望在保持甚至提升精度的同时，降低推理与参数成本，并减少对额外训练技巧的依赖。

Method: 1) 采用卷积式tokenizer提取局部视觉特征，降低初始序列长度；2) 通过token mixing模块在不使用注意力的前提下进行跨token信息交互；3) 使用sequence-pooling在特征维度上进行聚合，适配固定上下文长度并减少计算；4) 全架构不使用位置编码、mixup或学习率调度，强调结构本身的稳定性与效率。

Result: 在CIFAR100上，Top-1从36.50%显著提升至46.29%，Top-5从66.33%提升至76.31%；当上下文长度小于嵌入维度时，推理效率优于基于SDPA的Transformer；模型尺寸仅为对照的60%，训练稳定。

Conclusion: 该架构在固定上下文、短序列视觉任务中提供了精度、效率与稳定性的综合改进，可作为注意力模型的轻量替代方案；代码已开源，具备复现与扩展价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a vision model that adopts token mixing,
sequence-pooling, and convolutional tokenizers to achieve state-of-the-art
performance and efficient inference in fixed context-length tasks. In the
CIFAR100 benchmark, our model significantly improves the baseline of the top 1%
and top 5% validation accuracy from 36.50% to 46.29% and 66.33% to 76.31%,
while being more efficient than the Scaled Dot Product Attention (SDPA)
transformers when the context length is less than the embedding dimension and
only 60% the size. In addition, the architecture demonstrates high training
stability and does not rely on techniques such as data augmentation like mixup,
positional embeddings, or learning rate scheduling. We make our code available
on Github.

*Shaojin Wu,Mengqi Huang,Yufeng Cheng,Wenxu Wu,Jiahe Tian,Yiming Luo,Fei Ding,Qian He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USO提出一个统一框架同时优化“风格相似度”和“主体一致性”，通过三联数据、解耦训练与风格奖励学习（SRL），并发布联合评测基准USO-Bench，实验在开源模型中SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往把风格驱动与主体驱动生成割裂开来，优化一个往往牺牲另一个。本工作认为二者本质上都是内容与风格的解耦与重组问题，亟需一个统一方法与客观基准共同衡量。

Method: 1) 构建大规模三元组数据集：内容图、风格图、对应的风格化内容图；2) 解耦式学习：并行两条目标——风格对齐训练（对齐风格特征）与内容-风格解耦训练（从风格中分离内容）；3) 引入风格奖励学习SRL：通过奖励信号进一步强化风格匹配；4) 发布USO-Bench：同时评估风格相似性与主体忠实度的多指标基准。

Result: 在多项指标上，USO在“主体一致性”和“风格相似度”两维度均达到开源SOTA；广泛实验验证其有效性。

Conclusion: 统一的解耦-重组框架可以同时优化风格与主体两目标；SRL与三元数据进一步提升效果，并提供USO-Bench作为标准化评测工具。

Abstract: Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven
generation as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity,
whereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent
antagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single
framework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and
re-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven
research. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized
customization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset
consisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized
content images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that
simultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style
through two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and
content-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style
reward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's
performance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly
evaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art
performance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject
consistency and style similarity. Code and model:

### [52] [Can we make NeRF-based visual localization privacy-preserving?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18971)
*Maxime Pietrantoni,Martin Humenberger,Torsten Sattler,Gabriela Csurka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文关注NeRF在云端视觉定位中的隐私泄露风险，并提出评估协议与一种用自监督分割替代RGB训练的隐私友好型表示ppNeSF，在不泄露细节的前提下实现SOTA定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF在新视角合成与VL中表现优异，但其通过光度一致性训练会“记住”细粒度外观与几何细节，云端部署可能导致敏感信息被还原，现有工作缺乏系统化隐私评估与兼顾隐私-性能的表示。

Method: 1) 隐私评估协议：从表示中分离/移除颜色头后，分析几何分量仍可恢复细节的程度，以模拟攻击者能否重建敏感信息。2) 经验发现：基于光度损失训练的NeRF在几何中编码细节，易遭隐私攻击。3) 提出ppNeSF：用自监督得到的语义/实例级分割标签（而非RGB）训练“神经分割场”，在3D中学习判别性但更粗粒度的分割嵌入；利用该分割空间进行定位匹配和位姿估计。

Result: ppNeSF在多基准上的视觉定位达到或超越现有方法；在所提隐私评估下，较RGB训练的NeRF显著降低可恢复的细节与隐私泄露风险；即使移除颜色头，传统NeRF仍泄露细节的现象被实证验证。

Conclusion: NeRF的几何分量本身会泄露隐私，单纯去掉颜色头不足以防护。通过以自监督分割替代RGB训练得到的ppNeSF，可在保留3D判别性的同时抑制细粒度细节，从而实现隐私保护与高精度视觉定位的兼顾。

Abstract: Visual localization (VL) is the task of estimating the camera pose in a known
scene. VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the
scene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of
images or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,
NeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality
novel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising
privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as
sensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this
challenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess
privacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained
with photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry
representations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head
that predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving
Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation
supervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a
self-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable
scene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space
of ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding
state-of-the-art results.

### [53] [Enhancing Document VQA Models via Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18984)
*Eric López,Artemis Llabrés,Ernest Valveny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在多页文档VQA中，用检索增强生成（RAG）先检索相关片段再作答，能在不依赖超大模型或拼接全页的情况下显著提升效果与效率。文本检索（基于OCR）带来最高收益，纯视觉检索也能获益且无需OCR。关键增益来自检索与重排序，版面引导分块并未奏效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多页文档VQA常将所有页面拼接或依赖超大多模态模型，内存占用大、效率低。RAG在长文档问答中已显示潜力，但其在多页文档VQA的系统性作用、文本与纯视觉检索路径的比较及组件贡献尚不清晰。

Method: 提出并比较两类RAG流水线：1) 文本中心（用OCR token做检索与证据选择）；2) 纯视觉（不做OCR，通过视觉特征检索）。在多模型与多基准（MP-DocVQA、DUDE、InfographicVQA）上评测；并做消融，考察检索、重排序与版面引导分块（layout-guided chunking）的影响。

Result: 相对“拼接所有页面”基线：文本中心RAG最高提升+22.5 ANLS；纯视觉RAG在不做文本提取的情况下也达+5.0 ANLS。消融显示主要增益来自检索与重排序；多篇论文推崇的版面引导分块在这些数据集上无助益。提升在不同模型规模与多页数据集上均一致。

Conclusion: 针对多页文档VQA，先进行高质量证据检索与重排序的RAG策略能稳定提升准确率并降低资源消耗；OCR驱动的文本检索收益最大，但即使无OCR的视觉检索也有效。版面分块策略不必然带来好处。该策略对真实世界应用具实际价值。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents
that span dozens of pages, yet leading systems still concatenate every page or
rely on very large vision-language models, both of which are memory-hungry.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first
retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from
this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of
incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants -
text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR -
across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets
MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the
"concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant
achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An
ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the
gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent
works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts
accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring
its practical value for real-world Document VQA.

*Shaivi Malik,Hasnat Md Abdullah,Sriparna Saha,Amit Sheth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GRAS基准与GRAS Bias Score，系统评估VLM在性别、种族、年龄与肤色上的偏见；测试5个SOTA模型显示偏见显著，最好的得分也仅2/100；并指出VQA偏见评估需考虑多种问句表述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLM日益用于现实应用，但其在人口统计学属性上的偏见未被充分、系统地测量与比较；现有基准覆盖不足、指标不可解释，难以指导改进与部署。

Method: 1) 构建覆盖性别、种族、年龄、肤色的多样化GRAS数据集；2) 设计可解释的GRAS Bias Score量化偏见；3) 在五个SOTA VLM上统一评测；4) 在VQA场景中比较不同问句表述以检验评估稳健性。

Result: 五个VLM均呈现令人担忧的偏见水平；即使偏见最小的模型，其GRAS Bias Score也仅2/100；评估表明，VQA任务中对同一语义采用多种表述会影响偏见测量结果。

Conclusion: VLM当前存在显著的人口统计偏见；GRAS与其偏见得分提供了全面、可解释的评估框架；VQA偏见评估需多表述以获得可靠结果；代码与数据开放以促进复现与改进。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) become integral to real-world applications,
understanding their demographic biases is critical. We introduce GRAS, a
benchmark for uncovering demographic biases in VLMs across gender, race, age,
and skin tone, offering the most diverse coverage to date. We further propose
the GRAS Bias Score, an interpretable metric for quantifying bias. We benchmark
five state-of-the-art VLMs and reveal concerning bias levels, with the least
biased model attaining a GRAS Bias Score of only 2 out of 100. Our findings
also reveal a methodological insight: evaluating bias in VLMs with visual
question answering (VQA) requires considering multiple formulations of a
question. Our code, data, and evaluation results are publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: N/A


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: N/A

Method: N/A

Result: N/A

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing
three-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from
airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of
current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or
learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering
strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually
designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better
than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based
approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not
truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second
is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,
leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric
characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network
training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,
named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds
in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer
encoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance
masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the
segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module
(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to
enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,
we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the
influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss
to constrain the network training.

*Riju Marwah,Riya Arora,Navneet Yadav,Himank Arora*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MicroDetect-Net (MDN)：结合Nile Red荧光染色与卷积神经网络，对血液样本中的微塑料进行分割与计数，在276张染色荧光图像上取得约92%准确率与较高IoU/F1/Precision/Recall。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微塑料年产量巨大、已广泛污染环境与生物体，并对健康造成潜在危害（肝炎症、肠损伤、菌群失衡）。需要高效、自动化且敏感的检测手段，特别是在生物体液（如血液）中，以支撑风险评估与流行病学研究。

Method: 使用Nile Red对血液样本（以蛤类血液为主的替代模型）进行荧光染色，通过荧光显微成像获取数据；构建卷积神经网络进行语义/实例分割，实现微塑料碎片定位与计数；形成端到端流程：数据制备—荧光成像—CNN分割；以标准分割与分类指标评估性能。

Result: 在276张Nile Red荧光血液图像数据集上，MDN取得：Accuracy≈92%，IoU=87.4%，F1=92.1%，Precision=90.6%，Recall=93.7%，显示出较强的检测与分割能力。

Conclusion: MDN将Nile Red荧光染色与CNN有效结合，可在血液样本中高效检测与计数微塑料，方法具有可行性与良好性能；尽管以蛤血为模型存在与人血差异，但为向人类样本拓展与早期数据收集提供了方法学基础。

Abstract: With the prevalence of plastics exceeding 368 million tons yearly,
microplastic pollution has grown to an extent where air, water, soil, and
living organisms have all tested positive for microplastic presence. These
particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters in size, are no less harmful to
humans than to the environment. Toxicity research on microplastics has shown
that exposure may cause liver infection, intestinal injuries, and gut flora
imbalance, leading to numerous potential health hazards. This paper presents a
new model, MicroDetect-Net (MDN), which applies fluorescence microscopy with
Nile Red dye staining and deep learning to scan blood samples for
microplastics. Although clam blood has certain limitations in replicating real
human blood, this study opens avenues for applying the approach to human
samples, which are more consistent for preliminary data collection. The MDN
model integrates dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and segmentation
using a convolutional neural network to localize and count microplastic
fragments. The combination of convolutional networks and Nile Red dye for
segmentation produced strong image detection and accuracy. MDN was evaluated on
a dataset of 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images and achieved an
accuracy of ninety two percent. Robust performance was observed with an
Intersection over Union of 87.4 percent, F1 score of 92.1 percent, Precision of
90.6 percent, and Recall of 93.7 percent. These metrics demonstrate the
effectiveness of MDN in the detection of microplastics.

*Yi Pan,Yujia Zhang,Michael Kampffmeyer,Xiaoguang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ProPy，将CLIP体系结构性改造用于部分相关视频检索（PRVR）。通过“提示金字塔”建模多粒度事件语义，并用“祖先-后代交互机制”在多粒度间动态交互，实现跨三数据集SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PRVR仅需匹配视频片段而非整段，现有方法多用单模态特征建模，未充分利用CLIP等强大的视觉-语言预训练模型；需要一种能捕获多粒度语义并对齐文本与视频片段的框架。

Method: 在CLIP基础上进行结构性改造：1) 提示金字塔（Prompt Pyramid），构造并组织事件级提示，覆盖不同时间与语义粒度，以引导CLIP对多粒度片段表征；2) 祖先-后代交互机制（Ancestor-Descendant Interaction），在金字塔层级间进行动态语义交互与信息流动，增强跨粒度的一致性与相关性估计；整体用于文本查询与视频片段的匹配打分，实现PRVR。

Result: 在三个公开PRVR数据集上取得最新最优（SOTA）结果，较以往方法有显著提升（文中称“significant margins”）；代码开源于GitHub。

Conclusion: 多粒度提示组织与层级交互可有效释放CLIP在PRVR中的潜力，显著提升基于查询的片段级检索性能，为利用大规模视觉-语言模型解决细粒度检索任务提供了通用思路。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task
that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific
segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to
process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP
remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a
model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for
PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events,
ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that
organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels,
and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that
enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy
achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous
models by significant margins. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 用几何血管大数据做自监督预训练（以热核签名为目标）学习形状表示，然后在小型冠状动脉临床数据上提升壁面切应力（WSS）分区预测表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗影像下以机器学习估计血流动力学指标（如WSS）可替代耗时的CFD，但临床标注/配对数据稀缺，尤其在冠脉。需要利用大规模无标注血管几何数据，通过自监督/基础模型预训练，缓解小样本学习的瓶颈。

Method: 收集8449个3D血管几何模型，计算基于拉普拉斯特征向量的热核签名（HKS）作为自监督目标，训练几何表征学习模型；再将学到的表示迁移到一个包含49名患者的冠脉数据集，用于将冠脉表面按时间平均WSS分为低/中/高区域的分割任务。

Result: 预训练得到的几何表示在小样本（49例）下显著提升了WSS分区分割的性能，相比无预训练或基线方法更优。

Conclusion: 基于HKS的自监督形状表征能有效利用大规模无标注血管几何，改善冠脉WSS相关下游任务，证明在数据稀缺临床场景中的可行性与价值。

Abstract: Leveraging big data for patient care is promising in many medical fields such
as cardiovascular health. For example, hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear
stress could be assessed from patient-specific medical images via machine
learning algorithms, bypassing the need for time-intensive computational fluid
simulation. However, it is extremely challenging to amass large-enough datasets
to effectively train such models. We could address this data scarcity by means
of self-supervised pre-training and foundations models given large datasets of
geometric artery models. In the context of coronary arteries, leveraging
learned representations to improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment has not yet
been well studied. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a
large dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels
can benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a
small-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target
for the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity
obtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the
shapes. We show how geometric representations learned from this datasets can
boost segmentation of coronary arteries into regions of low, mid and high
(time-averaged) wall shear stress even when trained on limited data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SuperSimpleNet，一种统一多监督范式（无监督、弱监督、混合、全监督）的表面缺陷检测模型，在四个基准上达SOTA且推理<10ms。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业表面缺陷检测需要同时满足高精度、低时延和对多样标注的适应性；现有方法往往只适用于单一监督场景，难以在真实制造流程中的多源标注（从无标签到全标注）间切换或融合。

Method: 以SimpleNet为基础的判别式架构，加入三点改进：1）合成异常生成流程，用于在不同监督强度下提升泛化；2）增强的分类头（更强判别与定位能力）；3）改进的学习流程，可在无监督、弱监督、混合和全监督四种场景下统一训练与利用全部标注信息。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的基准数据集上，在上述四种监督设定均达成新的性能标杆；推理速度<10毫秒，兼具准确性与效率。

Conclusion: SuperSimpleNet首次在单一模型中统一多监督范式并充分利用可用标注，兼顾高精度与实时性，缩小学术方法与工业落地之间的差距；代码已开源。

Abstract: Surface defect detection is a critical task across numerous industries, aimed
at efficiently identifying and localising imperfections or irregularities on
manufactured components. While numerous methods have been proposed, many fail
to meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability.
Existing approaches are often constrained to specific supervision scenarios and
struggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world
manufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed
supervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we
propose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model
built on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel
synthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an
improved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four
supervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging
all available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets a new standard for
performance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four
challenging benchmark datasets. Beyond accuracy, it is very fast, achieving an
inference time below 10 ms. With its ability to unify diverse supervision
paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet
represents a promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing
challenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial
applications. Code: https://github.com/blaz-r/SuperSimpleNet

Abstract: Single-Pixel Imaging enables reconstructing objects using a single detector
through sequential illuminations with structured light patterns. We propose a
bilevel optimisation method for learning task-specific, binary illumination
patterns, optimised for applications like single-pixel fluorescence microscopy.
We address the non-differentiable nature of binary pattern optimisation using
the Straight-Through Estimator and leveraging a Total Deep Variation
regulariser in the bilevel formulation. We demonstrate our method on the
CytoImageNet microscopy dataset and show that learned patterns achieve superior
reconstruction performance compared to baseline methods, especially in highly
undersampled regimes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 用一个简单的偏心旋转振子给事件相机施加可控小幅振动，持续产生事件，再通过运动补偿去除引入的振动，从而在静态/低运动场景也能获得干净有用的事件数据，提升重建与边缘检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机在光照稳定、场景静止或低运动、相机固定时几乎不触发事件，导致许多视觉任务无法进行。现有“人为制造运动”的方案多依赖复杂硬件或额外光学组件，成本高、集成难。作者希望以低成本、轻量化方式维持事件产生，并能还原无振动的有用信号。

Method: 在相机上安装一个简单的旋转不平衡质量（偏心小电机），引入周期性微振动以诱发持续事件；同时设计一条运动补偿管线，估计并去除已知形态的注入运动，对事件进行对齐/去抖，得到“净化”的事件流，用于下游任务（图像重建、边缘检测）。

Result: 基于自制硬件原型，在真实数据集上验证：方法能稳定估计振动运动参数；相较于不诱导运动的基线，图像重建质量和边缘检测性能均有提升。

Conclusion: 简单低成本的机械振动配合运动补偿，可在静态或低运动场景中为事件相机持续提供高质量事件，提升下游感知任务效果，避免复杂硬件或光学方案。

Abstract: Event cameras are a bio-inspired class of sensors that asynchronously measure
per-pixel intensity changes. Under fixed illumination conditions in static or
low-motion scenes, rigidly mounted event cameras are unable to generate any
events, becoming unsuitable for most computer vision tasks. To address this
limitation, recent work has investigated motion-induced event stimulation that
often requires complex hardware or additional optical components. In contrast,
we introduce a lightweight approach to sustain persistent event generation by
employing a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational
motion. This is combined with a motion-compensation pipeline that removes the
injected motion and yields clean, motion-corrected events for downstream
perception tasks. We demonstrate our approach with a hardware prototype and
evaluate it on real-world captured datasets. Our method reliably recovers
motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection
over event-based sensing without motion induction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种小型UNet++结合拓扑/连通性敏感损失的少样本文本行分割方法，仅用每份手稿3页标注、基于小patch训练，在历史文档上显著超越现有SOTA（U-DIADS-TL上RA↑200%、Line IoU↑75%，DIVA-HisDB的F-Measure可达或超过竞赛冠军）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文档的文本行分割需要大量高质量标注，但获取困难且昂贵；深度模型常依赖大数据，难以迁移到各异的手稿。需在标注稀缺场景下提升精度与数据效率，并减少结构性错误（断裂、粘连）。

Method: 采用轻量UNet++作为分割骨干；引入最初用于神经元形态重建的connectivity-aware（拓扑感知）损失，显式惩罚线条断裂与误合并等结构错误；数据增广方式是从每份手稿仅三页标注中裁剪小patch进行训练，实现少样本学习。

Result: 在U-DIADS-TL数据集上，相比现有方法，识别准确率提升约200%，线条IoU提升约75%；在DIVA-HisDB基线检测任务上，F-Measure与竞赛冠军相当或更优；在极少标注（每份手稿3页）的条件下实现高性能。

Conclusion: 小而简的架构结合拓扑感知损失在少样本文档行分割中更高效、更准确；通过patch训练与连通性约束，可显著减少结构性错误，降低标注成本并提升SOTA水平。代码已开源，便于复现与应用。

Abstract: A foundational task for the digital analysis of documents is text line
segmentation. However, automating this process with deep learning models is
challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often
unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a
labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes
few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this
work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a
topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more
complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware
loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes
structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To
increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere
three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves
upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200%
increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over
Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even
exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection
task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy
of our approach. Our implementation is publicly available at:

### [63] [Dual Enhancement on 3D Vision-Language Perception for Monocular 3D Visual Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19165)
*Yuzhen Li,Min Liu,Yuan Bian,Xueping Wang,Zhaoyang Li,Gen Li,Yaonan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出两种简单有效的方法，增强单目3D视觉指代任务中“文本-几何”对齐与单位理解：通过文本单位多样化增强(3DTE)与文本引导的几何增强(TGE)，显著提升Mono3DRefer上性能，尤其“远距离”场景提升11.94%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型对几何数字敏感却忽视单位，等距换算(米→分米/厘米)会大幅掉点，暴露出文本特征缺乏物理量与单位一致性的3D理解能力，进而误导视觉几何感知。需要增强文本对单位与尺度的鲁棒理解，并更好地用文本指导几何特征。

Method: 1) 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE)：在文本端进行预处理/数据增强，系统引入多种距离单位与描述方式，学习单位间映射与尺度等价性，提升文本表示对单位变化的鲁棒性。2) Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE)：将基础文本特征投影到几何一致的表示空间，得到“3D增强”的文本特征，并用其精确引导几何特征的注意力分配，强化文本-几何对齐。

Result: 在Mono3DRefer上通过大量对比与消融验证，整体取得新的SOTA，特别是在“Far”场景准确率提升11.94%，显示方案对长距离/尺度敏感场景尤为有效。

Conclusion: 解决了文本对单位不敏感导致的3D理解薄弱问题。通过3DTE与TGE，模型在文本-几何对齐和尺度鲁棒性上显著增强，带来显著性能提升；方法简单通用，代码将开源。

Abstract: Monocular 3D visual grounding is a novel task that aims to locate 3D objects
in RGB images using text descriptions with explicit geometry information.
Despite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the text
embeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largely
ignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistant
mapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads to
severe performance degradation, even though the physical length remains
equivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trained
language model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3D
perception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on text
embeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods.
Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE),
which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between different
units by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries.
Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to further
enhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features into
geometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are then
leveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluate
the proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on the
Mono3DRefer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements
over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with a notable
accuracy gain of 11.94\% in the "Far" scenario. Our code will be made publicly
available.

### [64] [Beyond flattening: a geometrically principled positional encoding for vision transformers with Weierstrass elliptic functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19167)
*Zhihang Xin,Xitong Hu,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种针对ViT的位置编码——基于魏尔斯特拉斯椭圆函数（WEF-PE），直接在复数域对二维坐标编码，具备可导出相对位置、距离递减和与平移不变性相契合的性质，在CIFAR-100与VTAB-1k等上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ViT常用的一维可学习位置嵌入或正余弦编码会破坏图像二维结构，缺少几何约束，无法保证欧氏距离与序列索引距离的单调关系，削弱模型对空间邻近性的利用。

Method: 用魏尔斯特拉斯椭圆函数在复平面上直接对2D坐标编码：利用其双周期性匹配视觉数据的平移不变模式；非线性几何性质自然刻画空间距离；通过代数加法公式可由绝对编码直接得到任意patch对的相对位置信息；并给出距离衰减性质的理论证明与可视化分析。

Result: 在CIFAR-100从零训练的ViT-Tiny上达63.78%准确率；在ViT-Base微调CIFAR-100上93.28%；在VTAB-1k多任务上持续提升；注意力可视化显示更强几何归纳偏置与更连贯的语义聚焦。

Conclusion: WEF-PE提供了数学上严谨且与图像几何一致的位置编码，可在保持二维结构与相对位置信息可解的同时提升性能，并具备可证明的距离衰减与与平移模式相容的性质；代码已开源。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision
tasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings
fundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images
through patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches
lack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence
between Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby
limiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively.
We propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a
mathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional
coordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly
periodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational
invariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the
non-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance
relationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct
derivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs
from their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
WEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including
63.78\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture,
93.28\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on
VTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms the distance-decay
property through rigorous mathematical proof, while attention visualization
reveals enhanced geometric inductive bias and more coherent semantic focus
compared to conventional approaches.The source code implementing the methods
described in this paper is publicly available on GitHub.

Motivation: N/A

Method: N/A

Result: N/A

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into
sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens
sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably
reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each
vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long
token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose
an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and
faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an
autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count
to approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.
Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single
step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency
matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,
we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural
arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge
connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than
8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.

Motivation: N/A

Result: N/A

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant strides in
generating high-quality images. However, progressively manipulating certain
attributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains
challenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.
Some studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.
However, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is
trained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new
attribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy
accumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical
applications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this
issue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes
the text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute
directions. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling
interpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.
Moreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports
zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and
the composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving
notable improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our method can
be extended to integrate with the inversion framework to perform attribute
manipulation on real images, broadening its applicability to various real-world
scenarios. The code and trained model will be released at:

Result: N/A

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot
learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of
reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor
data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow
for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and
trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In
contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models
offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In
this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly
generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for
causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry
estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and
environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image
priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling
the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be
conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent
3D generations of complex driving scenes.

*Jianwen Jiang,Weihong Zeng,Zerong Zheng,Jiaqi Yang,Chao Liang,Wang Liao,Han Liang,Yuan Zhang,Mingyuan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出OmniHuman-1.5：在视频头像生成中，同时追求物理合理与语义一致的角色情感/意图表达，通过多模态LLM提供高层语义条件，并用改良的多模态DiT（含Pseudo Last Frame）融合音频、图像、文本，显著提升口型同步、画质、动作自然度与语义一致性，并可扩展到多人与非人主体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频头像多依赖低层节奏（如音频拍点）驱动，缺乏对情感、意图、上下文的理解，难以生成语义上“像”的角色动作，需要引入高层语义指导与更稳健的多模态融合机制。

Method: 1）用多模态大语言模型生成结构化文本条件，提供上下文、情绪、角色与场景约束的高层语义指导；2）提出多模态DiT架构并引入Pseudo Last Frame设计，专门用于融合音频/图像/文本，减少模态冲突，提升跨模态对齐；3）基于上述条件驱动的运动生成器产生语义一致、表情与肢体协调的动画。

Result: 在口型同步、视频质量、动作自然度、与文本语义一致性等多维指标上取得领先；能够处理复杂场景，包括多人交互与非人主体，展示良好可扩展性。

Conclusion: 通过将多模态LLM的高层语义条件与专门设计的多模态DiT融合机制相结合，OmniHuman-1.5能生成既物理可信又语义表达丰富的角色动画，显著优于仅依赖低层信号的传统方法，并具备在更复杂场景中的推广潜力。

Abstract: Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they
struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's
authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like
audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or
context. To bridge this gap, \textbf{we propose a framework designed to
generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also
semantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is
built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large
Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions
that provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion
generator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production
of actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure
the effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality
conflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel
Pseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to
accurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby
generating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and
linguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
leading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync
accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with
textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to
complex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VFTrack：一套在SEM序列中自动检测与跟踪单根碳纳米管（CNT）颗粒的原位实时跟踪框架，结合最佳特征（ALIKED+LightGlue），实现运动分解与生长动力学量化，用于实时优化CNT合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNT生长表征受限：离线（ex situ）只能做静态分析；原位（in situ）方法常需人工初始化，且缺乏对每个颗粒连续轨迹的分解与量化，难以获得动力学细节、区域异质性与形貌重建所需的数据。

Method: 构建VFTrack框架：在SEM图像序列中自动检测-匹配-跟踪单粒子轨迹，兼容手工与深度特征；通过大规模（13,540条人工标注轨迹）系统评测筛选特征/匹配器组合，确定ALIKED检测器+LightGlue匹配器最优；基于跟踪得到的运动向量，进行轴向生长、横向漂移与振荡的分解，进而进行运动学/形貌分析。

Result: 在基准数据上，ALIKED+LightGlue获得最佳性能（F1=0.78，α-score=0.89）。VFTrack实现了对CNT微柱生长的连续原位跟踪与运动分解，量化异质区域生长速率，并可重建随时间演化的柱状形貌。

Conclusion: VFTrack弥补了物理模型与实验观测之间的鸿沟：提供自动化、实时、可量化的纳米材料原位表征能力，可用于反馈控制与工艺优化，推动CNT合成与相关纳米制造的实时优化与机理研究。

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are critical building blocks in nanotechnology, yet
the characterization of their dynamic growth is limited by the experimental
challenges in nanoscale motion measurement using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) imaging. Existing ex situ methods offer only static analysis, while in
situ techniques often require manual initialization and lack continuous
per-particle trajectory decomposition. We present Visual Feature Tracking
(VFTrack) an in-situ real-time particle tracking framework that automatically
detects and tracks individual CNT particles in SEM image sequences. VFTrack
integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle
tracking framework to enable kinematic analysis of CNT micropillar growth. A
systematic using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories identifies the ALIKED
detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination (F1-score of 0.78,
$\alpha$-score of 0.89). VFTrack motion vectors decomposed into axial growth,
lateral drift, and oscillations, facilitate the calculation of heterogeneous
regional growth rates and the reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar
morphologies. This work enables advancement in automated nano-material
characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and
experimental observation to enable real-time optimization of CNT synthesis.

Result: N/A

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video
segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many
real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and
track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape
fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video
segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and
introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single
architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation.
Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state
and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of
AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial
speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS
2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior
universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster
training on 16-frame sequences.

Motivation: 4D（动态3D）风格化缺乏统一评测标准、公开数据与强基线，难以客观比较方法与推进进展；现有风格迁移多聚焦2D或静态3D，忽视时间与多视角一致性。

Method: 1) 构建Style4D-Bench：包含高分辨率动态4D场景集、感知与定量指标的评测协议（空间保真、时间一致、多视角一致）与一套强基线；2) 提出Style4D基线框架：基于4D Gaussian Splatting。三部分组件：a) 基本4DGS表征以稳固几何；b) Style Gaussian Representation：为高斯赋予轻量级逐高斯MLP，实现时空感知的外观控制；c) Holistic Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer：通过对比式一致性学习与结构内容保持，强化时空一致与几何不变。

Result: 在Style4D-Bench上的大量实验显示，Style4D在4D风格化中达到SOTA：细粒度风格细节、稳定时间动态与一致的多视角渲染。

Conclusion: Style4D-Bench为动态3D风格化建立标准化评测与数据资源；Style4D提供强基线并证明4DGS+时空一致学习的有效性，预计将促进该领域研究发展。

Abstract: We introduce Style4D-Bench, the first benchmark suite specifically designed
for 4D stylization, with the goal of standardizing evaluation and facilitating
progress in this emerging area. Style4D-Bench comprises: 1) a comprehensive
evaluation protocol measuring spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and
multi-view consistency through both perceptual and quantitative metrics, 2) a
strong baseline that make an initial attempt for 4D stylization, and 3) a
curated collection of high-resolution dynamic 4D scenes with diverse motions
and complex backgrounds. To establish a strong baseline, we present Style4D, a
novel framework built upon 4D Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three key
components: a basic 4DGS scene representation to capture reliable geometry, a
Style Gaussian Representation that leverages lightweight per-Gaussian MLPs for
temporally and spatially aware appearance control, and a Holistic
Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module designed to enhance spatio-temporal
consistency via contrastive coherence learning and structural content
preservation. Extensive experiments on Style4D-Bench demonstrate that Style4D
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D stylization, producing fine-grained
stylistic details with stable temporal dynamics and consistent multi-view
rendering. We expect Style4D-Bench to become a valuable resource for
benchmarking and advancing research in stylized rendering of dynamic 3D scenes.

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: We propose a training-free method, Articulate3D, to pose a 3D asset through
language control. Despite advances in vision and language models, this task
remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the
problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target
images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the
mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In
detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that
decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model,
allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We
observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation
optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between
input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated
across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully
manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh.
Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was
preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing
approaches. Project page:https://odeb1.github.io/articulate3d_page_deb/

Motivation: 现有3D编辑多从多视图图像编辑后再重建3D，容易破坏未编辑区域与整体一致性；需要一种能在3D层面精确控制局部、并保持全局连贯的方法与评测基准。

Method: 1) 以给定3D模型为输入，进行扩散模型的“反演轨迹”预测，得到每个时间步的倒推潜向量与注意力KV缓存；2) 在去噪与编辑阶段，对标注的保留区域，将其去噪特征替换为对应时间步的反演潜与KV，确保保留区复现；对编辑区域按目标指令/条件进行正常去噪；3) 通过上下文特征保留实现保留区与编辑区的连贯融合。

Result: 构建了包含数百样本、具精确3D编辑掩膜的人为标注数据集Edit3D-Bench，用于评估保留区域一致性；在该基准与其他设置下，VoxHammer在保留区域3D一致性与整体质量上均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 在3D潜空间进行局部编辑并注入反演KV上下文可在不训练的情况下实现高保真保留与连贯编辑；方法适用于生成高质量编辑配对数据，为后续的in-context 3D生成奠定数据基础。

Abstract: 3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot
interaction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then
reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving
unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative
models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs
precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer
first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and
key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing
phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the
corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these
contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of
preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the
consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a
human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully
labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of
preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for
synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data
foundation for in-context 3D generation. See our project page at

Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of
disability worldwide. Clinical guidelines establish diffusion resonance imaging
(DWI, ADC) as the standard for localizing, characterizing, and measuring
infarct volume, enabling treatment support and prognosis. Nonetheless, such
lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics,
scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Computational support approaches have
been key to helping with the localization and segmentation of lesions. However,
these strategies are dedicated solutions that learn patterns from only one
institution, lacking the variability to generalize geometrical lesions shape
models. Even worse, many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled samples to
adjust these dedicated solutions. This work developed a collaborative framework
for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in DWI sequences by sharing knowledge
from deep center-independent representations. From 14 emulated healthcare
centers with 2031 studies, the FedAvg model achieved a general DSC of $0.71 \pm
0.24$, AVD of $5.29 \pm 22.74$, ALD of $2.16 \pm 3.60$ and LF1 of $0.70 \pm
0.26$ over all centers, outperforming both the centralized and other federated
rules. Interestingly, the model demonstrated strong generalization properties,
showing uniform performance across different lesion categories and reliable
performance in out-of-distribution centers (with DSC of $0.64 \pm 0.29$ and AVD
of $4.44 \pm 8.74$ without any additional training).

TL;DR: 评估SalUn在医学图像分类中的机器反学习性能：在PathMNIST、OrganAMNIST、BloodMNIST上接近完全重训效果，并探讨数据增强对反学习质量的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗模型常含有敏感或隐私数据，需在不牺牲模型鲁棒性的前提下“忘记”这部分数据。现有反学习方法多在通用数据集上验证，医学图像领域尚缺系统评估，因此需要检验SalUn在医学任务中的可行性与效率。

Method: 选用三类医学图像数据集（PathMNIST、OrganAMNIST、BloodMNIST），采用SalUn作为反学习方法，与完全重训作为上限基线对比；并引入不同的数据增强策略，分析其对反学习质量（如遗忘程度与保留性能）的影响。

Result: SalUn在三个数据集上的性能接近完全重训基线，说明其能有效移除指定数据影响且保持模型准确性与鲁棒性；数据增强对提升反学习质量有一定积极作用（摘要暗示但未给出具体数值）。

Conclusion: SalUn为医学图像分类中的高效反学习方案，能在不耗费完全重训成本的情况下实现接近等效的遗忘与性能保留，具备医学应用潜力。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove private or sensitive data from a
pre-trained model while preserving the model's robustness. Despite recent
advances, this technique has not been explored in medical image classification.
This work evaluates the SalUn unlearning model by conducting experiments on the
PathMNIST, OrganAMNIST, and BloodMNIST datasets. We also analyse the impact of
data augmentation on the quality of unlearning. Results show that SalUn
achieves performance close to full retraining, indicating an efficient solution
for use in medical applications.

*Yuhui Tao,Yizhe Zhang,Qiang Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出在弱监督框架下，用“层结构引导的后处理”+“测试时自适应(TTA)”提升SD-OCT中黄斑水肿(EA)分割，显著缩小与全监督的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 像素级标注昂贵，现有基于异常检测的弱监督EA分割虽有前景但精度不及全监督。观察到EA与视网膜分层在SD-OCT上强相关，且弱监督可在推理时迭代/更新，作者希望利用层结构先验与测试域自适应缓解域差异与形状不稳定问题。

Method: 以现成对抗式弱监督框架为骨干：1) 层结构引导后处理：借助额外的视网膜层位置信息，将密集EA预测转化为“EA轮廓与各层的交点确认”问题，使结果符合EA形状先验并过滤伪阳性。2) 测试时自适应（TTA）：在测试阶段利用无标注样本进行轻量参数更新/校准，缓解训练-测试在EA表现与呈现上的差异。

Result: 在两个公开SD-OCT数据集上进行大量实验，加入两项组件后，分割精度与鲁棒性均提升，弱监督与全监督方法间的性能差距被明显缩小。

Conclusion: 利用视网膜分层先验的后处理与TTA可有效强化弱监督EA分割，对昂贵标注依赖降低且跨域泛化更好，为临床可用的低标注成本ME分析提供可行路径。

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence models for macular edema (ME)
analy-sis always relies on expert-annotated pixel-level image datasets which
are expen-sive to collect prospectively. While anomaly-detection-based
weakly-supervised methods have shown promise in edema area (EA) segmentation
task, their per-formance still lags behind fully-supervised approaches. In this
paper, we leverage the strong correlation between EA and retinal layers in
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images, along with the
update characteristics of weakly-supervised learning, to enhance an
off-the-shelf adversarial framework for EA segmentation with a novel
layer-structure-guided post-processing step and a test-time-adaptation (TTA)
strategy. By incorporating additional retinal lay-er information, our framework
reframes the dense EA prediction task as one of confirming intersection points
between the EA contour and retinal layers, result-ing in predictions that
better align with the shape prior of EA. Besides, the TTA framework further
helps address discrepancies in the manifestations and presen-tations of EA
between training and test sets. Extensive experiments on two pub-licly
available datasets demonstrate that these two proposed ingredients can im-prove
the accuracy and robustness of EA segmentation, bridging the gap between
weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.

*Jan Nikolas Morshuis,Matthias Hein,Christian F. Baumgartner*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 首次建立加速MRI欠采样分割的统一基准，比较7种方法，结果显示考虑数据一致性的简单两阶段方案优于复杂一体化方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI采集慢、成本高，虽然有加速重建算法，但许多临床场景的目标是下游分割而非完美图像。现有“直接在加速数据上分割”的方法彼此独立、数据与评测不统一，缺乏系统比较，最佳策略不明。

Method: 构建统一基准：选择两套含多通道k-space与人工分割标注的数据；系统实现并评测7种代表性方法，重点对比一阶段（重建+分割端到端联合）与两阶段（先重建再分割）框架；统一数据、欠采样设置、训练与评测协议，采用包含数据一致性的MRI重建模块。

Result: 在两套数据上，两阶段方法（先做数据一致性约束的重建，再用常规分割网络）取得最高分割指标；多种专为端到端任务设计的复杂一阶段模型未能超越该简单基线。

Conclusion: 在欠采样MRI的分割任务中，优先采用强调数据一致性的两阶段管线更稳健、更准确；复杂联合模型的优势并未体现。基准为后续研究提供了可复现的比较平台与标准。

Abstract: MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool allowing to non-invasively visualize
patient anatomy and pathology with high soft-tissue contrast. However, MRI
acquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and
increased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial
research effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI
acquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the
fully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly
reconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary
goal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing
interest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated
MRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed
in isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or
private datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no
high-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal
strategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper
provides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI
data comparing 7 approaches. A particular focus is placed on comparing
\textit{one-stage approaches}, that combine reconstruction and segmentation
into a unified model, with \textit{two-stage approaches}, that utilize
established MRI reconstruction methods followed by a segmentation network. We
test these methods on two MRI datasets that include multi-coil k-space data as
well as a human-annotated segmentation ground-truth. We find that simple
two-stage methods that consider data-consistency lead to the best segmentation
scores, surpassing complex specialized methods that are developed specifically
for this task.

Conclusion: N/A

Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion
model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data.
While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are
caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these
models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor
RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge
devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by
directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional
two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple
adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the
out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE
(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone
Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To
compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation
pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for
large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)
LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion
methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Deep understanding of electromagnetic signals is fundamental to dynamic
spectrum management, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and
unmanned vehicle perception. The field faces challenges because electromagnetic
signals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong
background noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents
existing general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and
sensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and
transfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the
creation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these
issue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that
bridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We
build the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset
covering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties
of electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing
method and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and
representation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals. Experiments
show that EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across
many downstream tasks, moving decisively from task specific models to a unified
framework for electromagnetic intelligence. The code is available at:
https://github.com/GabrielleTse/EMind.
